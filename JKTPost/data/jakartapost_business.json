Rushil Mohan, the founder of logistics technology start-up Pidge, said the lack of clear guidelines forced companies to be more cautious, especially in handling personal data and building predictive models, as the firm explores expansion in Indonesia. “When you don’t have clarity, you have to choose to be safe, and safety can often be at odds with innovation,” he said to on Feb. 5. “If there were clearer guardrails and guidelines, what kind of regulation, what kind of models and what kind of outcomes are allowed, supported and encouraged, it would allow us to double down, triple down on our investments into AI.” Pidge deliberately avoids using personally identifiable information in its AI models, relying instead on aggregated and anonymized data.

(SKK Migas/SKK Migas.) nergy and Mineral Resources Minister Bahlil Lahadalia is putting pressure on oil and gas producers to make progress on stalled projects as he warned that hundreds of abandoned areas stood to lose their operating licenses. Bahlil remarked that the government had previously tried a similar approach with investors, threatening them with ultimatums to push them to realize their investments. He cited as an example the gas-rich Masela Block managed by Japanese oil and gas giant Inpex, noting that it showed little progress over its 26-year concession. “However, after they received the ‘love letter’, [praise be to God], now the investment of around US$18 billion has begun. So I think this is what we will do going forward,” the minister said. The country has experienced a long-term decline in oil production since nationwide output peaked at 1.5-1.6 million barrels per day (mbpd) in 1996-1997, gradually falling thereafter to 580,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024. Meanwhile, the government’s oil lifting targets have regularly gone unmet since 2016.

However, Bahlil noted that realized production of 605,300 bpd in 2025 marginally surpassed that year’s budget target of 605,000 bpd, marking the first time the national lifting target had been met in nearly a decade.

Published on 2026-02-16T12:52:05+07:00 http://www.thejakartapost.com/business/2026/02/16/idle-oil-and-gas-projects-risk-losing-licenses-bahlil-warns.html The sun sets beyond an oil and gas rig operated by Saka Energi Muriah Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of state gas company PGN, in the Kepodang Field of the Muriah Block off Semarang, Central Java, in this undated handout photo. (SKK Migas/SKK Migas.) nergy and Mineral Resources Minister Bahlil Lahadalia is putting pressure on oil and gas producers to make progress on stalled projects as he warned that hundreds of abandoned areas stood to lose their operating licenses. Bahlil remarked that the government had previously tried a similar approach with investors, threatening them with ultimatums to push them to realize their investments. He cited as an example the gas-rich Masela Block managed by Japanese oil and gas giant Inpex, noting that it showed little progress over its 26-year concession. “However, after they received the ‘love letter’, [praise be to God], now the investment of around US$18 billion has begun. So I think this is what we will do going forward,” the minister said. The country has experienced a long-term decline in oil production since nationwide output peaked at 1.5-1.6 million barrels per day (mbpd) in 1996-1997, gradually falling thereafter to 580,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024. Meanwhile, the government’s oil lifting targets have regularly gone unmet since 2016.

However, Bahlil noted that realized production of 605,300 bpd in 2025 marginally surpassed that year’s budget target of 605,000 bpd, marking the first time the national lifting target had been met in nearly a decade.

The projects are the first investments under Japan's $550 billion US investment pledge as part of a trade deal that cut Trump's tariffs on Japanese imports to 15 percent, Trump said on Truth Social. He gave few details about the projects. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement that the Portsmouth, Ohio power plant, valued at $33 billion, would be the largest natural gas-fired generating facility in US history, generating 9.2 gigawatts of electricity annually, more than enough to power all of the homes in Ohio. The facility, to be operated by SB Energy, a subsidiary of Japanese tech investor SoftBank Group, would increase baseload power at a time of fast-growing electricity demand from data centers built to power artificial intelligence applications. The White House said Japan would invest in the $2.1 billion Texas GulfLink deepwater crude oil export facility off the Texas coast. \"This project is expected to generate $20–30 billion annually in US crude exports, secure export capacity for our refineries, and reinforce America’s position as the world’s leading energy supplier,\" Lutnick said.

Texas GulfLink, which is being developed by Sentinel Midstream, confirmed that it was part of the initiative and was \"honored to be a trusted partner with the US Department of Commerce and the government of Japan.\" Trump said the Texas investments would include a liquefied natural gas project, but Lutnick's statement and a White House fact sheet did not mention LNG. Lutnick said the third major project in Georgia was a synthetic industrial diamond manufacturing plant that would satisfy 100 percent of US demand for synthetic diamond grit, a critical input for advanced manufacturing and semiconductor production. The US currently relies largely on China for such supplies. The high-pressure synthetic diamond plant valued at about $600 million, will be operated by Element Six, the White House said in a fact sheet. The industrial diamond company is a unit of De Beers Group, the world's largest diamond producer. It was unclear how much of the projects' costs would be funded by Japanese entities and under what conditions. Under an earlier US-Japan agreement, profits from the projects were due to be shared 50-50 between the US and Japan until Japan's initial investment costs were recouped, after which profits would be split 90-10 in favor of the US. The administration's announcements followed meetings last week between Lutnick and Japan's economic and trade minister Ryosei Akazawa. Akazawa told reporters on Thursday that several issues remained unresolved before deals could be announced. \"The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.
