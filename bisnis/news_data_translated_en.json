    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA – President Prabowo Subianto stated that his government had succeeded in saving the state budget of around US$18 billion or around Rp. 303.14 trillion in the first few months of his leadership.\n\nThis statement was made while attending the US–Asean Business Summit at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington D.C., Thursday (19/2/2026).\n\nAccording to Prabowo, these savings come from cutting inefficiencies and canceling projects that are considered unproductive. He assessed that this step was in line with bureaucratic efficiency efforts which were also of concern to a number of other countries.\n\n\"I feel like I am one of the Indonesian presidents who in the first three months of his administration managed to save US$ 18 billion in cash,\" he said.\n\nPrabowo revealed that one of the efficiency measures was to reduce expenditure on ceremonial activities in government agencies. He assessed that the tradition of celebrating institutional and regional birthdays often costs large budgets without having a direct impact on society.\n\nHe asked that the celebration be held simply in an office environment, for example by having lunch together, in order to maintain rational budget use.\n\nAlso Read\n\nApart from that, the government also cut the costs of overseas official travel which previously reached billions of dollars. Prabowo highlighted the practice of comparative studies abroad which was deemed ineffective and irrelevant to Indonesia's needs.\n\nThe head of state also cited the visit of a comparative study team to Australia to study poverty alleviation, which he said was inappropriate considering that the country is one of the richest countries in the world. He also mentioned a visit to Japan during the Christmas holidays which made the discussion agenda not run optimally.\n\nPrabowo admits that efficiency policies are not easy to implement. He said that there had been demonstrations opposing this move, which he said was an unusual phenomenon.\n\n“This is probably the first time in world history that there have been demonstrations against government efficiency,” he said.\n\nNevertheless, he emphasized his commitment to continue to cut waste in order to create legal certainty and a healthy investment climate. The number one person in Indonesia also believes that investors will not enter a country with uncertainty and weak law enforcement.\n\n\"In my opinion, as someone who has also been a foreign investor in this country, no one wants to enter an economy that is full of uncertainty, or that does not have confidence in the legal process and law enforcement. This is one of the most important things,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, the 8th President of the Republic of Indonesia also highlighted changes in communication patterns between the government and society in the digital era. He admitted that he often received direct messages from residents, including village children, who conveyed the condition of infrastructure in their area.\n\nThe statement emphasizes the Prabowo government's focus on budget efficiency, rational governance, and quick response to people's needs as part of efforts to strengthen public trust and attract investment.\n\nPrabowo believes that increasingly open access to information requires the government to respond quickly to the needs of the community so that the state's presence is truly felt.\n\n\"We have to react quickly so that they feel that the central government and their President are listening and acting,\" said Prabowo.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA – Presiden Prabowo Subianto menyatakan pemerintahannya berhasil menghemat anggaran negara sekitar US$18 miliar atau sekitar Rp303,14 triliun dalam beberapa bulan pertama masa kepemimpinannya.\n\nPernyataan tersebut disampaikan saat menghadiri Business Summit US–Asean di U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington D.C., Kamis (19/2/2026).\n\nMenurut Prabowo, penghematan tersebut berasal dari pemangkasan inefisiensi dan pembatalan proyek-proyek yang dinilai tidak produktif. Dia menilai langkah ini sejalan dengan upaya efisiensi birokrasi yang juga menjadi perhatian sejumlah negara lain.\n\n“Saya merasa menjadi salah satu Presiden Indonesia yang dalam tiga bulan pertama pemerintahannya berhasil menghemat US$18 miliar secara tunai,” ujarnya.\n\nPrabowo mengungkapkan bahwa salah satu langkah efisiensi dilakukan dengan mengurangi pengeluaran untuk kegiatan seremonial di instansi pemerintah. Dia menilai tradisi perayaan hari ulang tahun lembaga dan daerah sering menghabiskan anggaran besar tanpa dampak langsung bagi masyarakat.\n\nDia meminta perayaan dilakukan secara sederhana di lingkungan kantor, misalnya dengan makan siang bersama, guna menjaga rasionalitas penggunaan anggaran.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nSelain itu, pemerintah juga memangkas biaya perjalanan dinas luar negeri yang sebelumnya mencapai miliaran dolar. Prabowo menyoroti praktik studi banding ke luar negeri yang dinilai tidak efektif dan tidak relevan dengan kebutuhan Indonesia.\n\nKepala negara pun mencontohkan kunjungan tim studi banding ke Australia untuk mempelajari pengentasan kemiskinan, yang menurutnya tidak tepat mengingat negara tersebut termasuk salah satu negara terkaya di dunia. Ia juga menyinggung kunjungan ke Jepang pada masa libur Natal yang membuat agenda diskusi tidak berjalan optimal.\n\nPrabowo mengakui kebijakan efisiensi tidak mudah diterapkan. Dia menyebut sempat muncul demonstrasi yang menentang langkah tersebut, yang menurutnya menjadi fenomena tidak lazim.\n\n“Ini mungkin pertama kalinya dalam sejarah dunia ada demonstrasi yang menentang efisiensi pemerintah,” katanya.\n\nKendati demikian, dia menegaskan komitmennya untuk terus memangkas pemborosan demi menciptakan kepastian hukum dan iklim investasi yang sehat.

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Minister of Finance (Menkeu) Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa finally revealed the reason the budget deficit in 2025 could reach 2.92% of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nPurbaya said that last year's budget deficit, which almost touched the 3% limit, was deliberately maximized to ensure a reversal in the direction of economic growth.\n\nAs a result, the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) reported that the economy grew 5.11% throughout the year and reached a post-pandemic high in the fourth quarter of 2025, namely 5.39%.\n\n\"That's actually a very smart strategy. We don't exceed the 3% [limit], expand fiscally, give stimulus to the economy, the economy will return. We just have to run, we just have to manage the future as to what the economy will be like,\" said Purbaya, quoted on Thursday (19/2/2025).\n\nOn the other hand, Purbaya also said that the central government debt ratio was still within safe limits even though the figure had reached 40.46% of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nHe then compared it with several Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand whose debt ratios are above 50%.\n\nAlso Read\n\n\"It's okay. So what? Singapore? How much? [More than 100%]. Malaysia how much? [More than 60%]. Thailand how much? Just check Thailand how much. With that standard, we are still safe,\" explained Purbaya to journalists after the Sumatra Post-Disaster Recovery Task Force coordination meeting (coordination meeting) with the DPR at the Senayan Parliament Complex, Jakarta, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) emphasized that the Indonesian government needs to be careful in expanding capital expenditure in order to encourage economic growth to realize the target of becoming a developed country by 2045.\n\nBased on the Selected Issues Paper report entitled Golden Vision 2045: Making the Most Out of Public Investment which was released in early February 2026, the IMF estimates that Indonesia needs real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% every year for the next two decades to achieve high-income country status in accordance with the vision of Golden Indonesia 2045.\n\nTo achieve that, the IMF identified increasing public investment as its main pillar. However, capital expenditure expansion must be accompanied by an increase in tax revenues so that the APBN deficit does not exceed the 3% threshold of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThe IMF report underlines that revenue mobilization is an absolute requirement to create loose fiscal space for the expansion of infrastructure and public projects.\n\n\"Mobilization of additional revenues will create the fiscal space needed to increase the scale of public investment while maintaining compliance with Indonesia's long-standing fiscal rules,\" explained the IMF research team consisting of Tsendsuren Batsuuri, Raju Huidrom and Philippe Wingender in the report, quoted on Saturday (14/2/2026).\n\nIn the framework of its macroeconomic simulations, the institution headquartered in Washington D.C. It projects that various domestic revenue extraction measures could contribute incremental state revenues of around 0.3 percentage points of GDP.\n\nAs an illustrative instrument, the IMF model offers the option of increasing employee income tax (labor income tax) to reduce the government's dependence on deficit financing. However, the IMF provides thick notes regarding the stages of the execution of this tax policy.\n\nThe IMF formulated that the initial surge in public investment funding be financed entirely through the budget deficit. As time goes by and the wheels of the economy begin to turn faster due to this investment, labor income tax collection is gradually increased.\n\nThis strategy of delaying the tax burden at the start is considered crucial so that tax pressure does not injure or put a brake on the rate of economic growth which is just about to take off.\n\nThrough a combination of these maneuvers, the overall fiscal deficit posture is believed to be maintained below 3%, based on the baseline realization of the 2024 APBN deficit at the level of 2.3% of GDP.\n\nMoreover, the IMF emphasized that if the government combines this with structural reform, economic growth will accelerate and revenues will in turn further reduce the deficit.\n\n\"Increasing efficiency will require strengthening public investment management practices across all levels of government, improving project selection through rigorous project assessments that take into account positive spillover impacts, while ensuring agile oversight safeguards to minimize risks while avoiding bottlenecks,\" the report concludes.\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of Finance Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa believes that increasing the role of the private sector in economic activities will help reduce the APBN deficit as well as the government debt ratio.\n\nPurbaya does not deny that he is currently concerned about the fiscal deficit which is at risk of exceeding the 3% of GDP limit. Nevertheless, he believes that accelerated economic growth can be realized without having to violate the APBN deficit limit.\n\nHe reflected on the era of the administration of the 6th President of the Republic of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), where the economy was able to grow at 6%, while the debt to GDP ratio actually shrank to 23%.\n\n\"Why? Because the private sector is working, so that could happen. If I combined the private and government sectors, the nominal debt could be flat, but the economy would grow faster,\" he told journalists after the Indonesia Economic Outlook event at Wisma Danantara, Jakarta, quoted on Saturday (14/2/2026).\n\nCurrently, the government debt ratio is around 40% of GDP. Regarding efforts to reduce this ratio, Purbaya explained the natural mechanism of economic growth.\n\nAccording to him, if GDP grows faster then mathematically the denominator of debt becomes larger, so the debt ratio automatically decreases. On the other hand, escalating economic growth will also increase tax revenues.\n\nFurthermore, the former chairman of the board of commissioners of the Deposit Insurance Corporation underlined that an economy driven by the private sector has historically produced a higher tax ratio, aka tax to GDP ratio.\n\nThe reason, continued Purbaya, is that private entities tend to have limitations in requesting various incentives or tax cuts compared to government projects. Purbaya compared that the average tax ratio during the SBY administration era was around 0.5% to 1% higher compared to the era of President Joko Widodo.\n\n\"That's almost automatic. If I get an additional ratio of just 0.5% from economic growth, I can get additional tax revenue of around Rp. 100 trillion. So there is hope there as long as we improve it in the future,\" he explained.\n\nTo ensure that the tax ratio really rises along with the movement of private machines, the Ministry of Finance is also carrying out internal improvements in state revenue collecting institutions.\n\nPurbaya emphasized that his party had carried out a 'clean up' of the organization by rotating dozens of officials at the Directorate General of Customs and Excise and the Directorate General of Taxes to optimize collection performance.\n\nHe also admitted that he was optimistic that the strategy to encourage the private sector could produce results, reflecting on the achievement of economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2025 which successfully reached 5.39%, higher than the previous quarters.\n\n\"It's not easy, but I'm sure that with yesterday's results [in the fourth quarter of 2025], it looks like our movement in that direction is correct,\" said Purbaya.",

    "title_original": "Purbaya Buka-bukaan Alasan Maksimalkan Defisit APBN 2025 hingga Nyaris 3%",
    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Menteri Keuangan (Menkeu) Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa akhirnya mengungkap alasan defisit anggaran pada tahun 2025 bisa menembus angka 2,92% dari produk domestik bruto (PDB).\n\nPurbaya mengatakan bahwa defisit anggaran tahun lalu yang nyaris menyentuh batas 3% sengaja dimaksimalkan untuk memastikan pembalikan arah pertumbuhan ekonomi.\n\nAlhasil, Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) melaporkan ekonomi tumbuh 5,11% sepanjang tahun dan mencapai rekor tertinggi pascapandemi pada kuartal IV/2025 yakni 5,39%.\n\n\"Itu sebetulnya strategi yang amatsmart. Kami enggak lewatin [batas] 3%, ekspansi fiskal, kasih stimulus ke ekonomi, ekonominya balik. Tinggal kami lari, tinggal atur ke depan seperti apa yang ramai ekonominya,\" tutur Purbaya dikutip, Kamis (19/2/2025).\n\nDi sisi lain, Purbaya juga mengatakan bahwa rasio utang pemerintah pusat masih dalam batas aman kendati angkanya telah menembus 40,46% dari produk domestik bruto (PDB).\n\nDia kemudian membandingkannya dengan beberapa negara kawasan Asia Tenggara seperti Singapura, Malaysia dan Thailand yang rasio utangnya berada di atas 50%.\n\nBaca Juga\n\n\"Enggak apa-apa. Memang kenapa? Singapura berapa? [Lebih dari 100%]. Malaysia berapa? [Lebih dari 60%]. Thailand berapa? Coba cek aja Thailand berapa. Dengan standar itu, kami masih aman,\" terangnya Purbaya kepada wartawan usai rapat koordinasi (rakor) Satgas Pemulihan Pascabencana Sumatra bersama DPR di Kompleks Parlemen Senayan, Jakarta, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nAdapun Dana Moneter Internasional (IMF) menekankan pemerintah Indonesia perlu berhati-hati melakukan ekspansi belanja modal demi mendorong pertumbuhan ekonomi untuk mewujudkan target menjadi negara maju pada 2045.\n\nBerdasarkan laporanSelected Issues Paper bertajuk Golden Vision 2045: Making The Most Out of Public Investmentyang dirilis awal Februari 2026, IMF menaksir Indonesia membutuhkan pertumbuhan produk domestik bruto (PDB) riil di kisaran 5,5% hingga 6,5% setiap tahunnya selama dua dekade ke depan untuk mencapai status negara berpendapatan tinggi sesuai visi Indonesia Emas 2045.\n\nUntuk mencapai itu, IMF mengidentifikasi peningkatan investasi publik sebagai pilar utamanya. Kendati demikian, ekspansi belanja modal itu wajib berbarengan dengan peningkatan penerimaan pajak agar defisit APBN tidak melampaui ambang batas 3% terhadap produk domestik bruto (PDB).\n\nLaporan IMF menggarisbawahi bahwa mobilisasi penerimaan adalah syarat mutlak guna menciptakan ruang fiskal yang longgar bagi ekspansi proyek infrastruktur dan publik.\n\n\"Mobilisasi tambahan penerimaan akan menciptakan ruang fiskal yang dibutuhkan untuk meningkatkan skala investasi publik sembari mempertahankan kepatuhan terhadap aturan fiskal Indonesia yang telah berjalan lama,\" papar tim peneliti IMF yang beranggotakan Tsendsuren Batsuuri, Raju Huidrom, dan Philippe Wingender dalam laporan tersebut, dikutip Sabtu (14/2/2026).\n\nDalam kerangka simulasi makroekonominya, lembaga yang bermarkas di Washington D.C. tersebut memproyeksikan bahwa berbagai langkah ekstraksi penerimaan domestik dapat menyumbang tambahan pendapatan negara secara bertahap sekitar 0,3 poin persentase dari PDB.\n\nSebagai salah satu instrumen ilustratif, model IMF menyodorkan opsi peningkatan pajak penghasilan karyawan (labor income tax) untuk mengurangi ketergantungan pemerintah pada pembiayaan defisit. Meski demikian, IMF memberikan catatan tebal terkait tahapan dari eksekusi kebijakan perpajakan ini.\n\nIMF merumuskan agar lonjakan awal pendanaan investasi publik dibiayai sepenuhnya lewat defisit anggaran. Seiring dengan berjalannya waktu dan roda ekonomi yang mulai berputar lebih kencang akibat investasi tersebut, barulah penarikan pajak penghasilan tenaga kerja ditingkatkan secara bertahap.\n\nStrategi penundaan beban pajak di awal ini dinilai krusial agar tekanan pajak tidak mencederai atau mengerem laju pertumbuhan ekonomi yang baru saja akan lepas landas.\n\nMelalui kombinasi manuver tersebut, postur defisit fiskal secara keseluruhan diyakini akan tetap terjaga di bawah 3%, berdasarkan baseline realisasi defisit APBN 2024 di level 2,3% dari PDB.\n\nTerlebih, IMF menekankan jika pemerintah mengkombinasikannya dengan reformasi struktural maka pertumbuhan ekonomi akan semakin terakselerasi dan penerimaan yang pada gilirannya akan semakin menekan defisit.\n\n\"Peningkatan efisiensi akan membutuhkan penguatan praktik manajemen investasi publik di seluruh tingkat pemerintahan, meningkatkan seleksi proyek melalui penilaian proyek yang ketat dengan mempertimbangkan dampak rambatan positif, sembari memastikan perlindungan pengawasan yang tangkas untuk meminimalkan risiko sekaligus menghindari hambatan,\" simpul laporan tersebut.\n\nSementara itu, Menteri Keuangan Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa meyakini peningkatan peran swasta dalam aktivitas perekonomian akan ikut menekan defisit APBN sekaligus rasio utang pemerintah.\n\nPurbaya tidak menampik bahwa saat ini kekhawatiran terhadap defisit fiskal yang berisiko melewati batas 3% dari PDB. Kendati demikian, dia meyakini akselerasi pertumbuhan ekonomi bisa terealisasi tanpa harus melanggar batas defisit APBN.\n\nDia berkaca pada era pemerintahan Presiden ke-6 RI Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), yang mana ekonomi mampu tumbuh di level 6%, sementara rasio utang terhadap PDB justru menyusut ke level 23%.\n\n\"Kenapa? Karena yang bergerak sektor swasta, jadi itu bisa terjadi. Kalau saya gabung sektor swasta dan pemerintah, bisa saja nominal utangnya flat [rata], tetapi ekonominya tumbuh lebih cepat,\" ujarnya kepada wartawan usai acara Indonesia Economic Outlook di Wisma Danantara, Jakarta, dikutip Sabtu (14/2/2026).\n\nSaat ini, rasio utang pemerintah berada di kisaran 40% terhadap PDB. Terkait upaya menurunkan rasio tersebut, Purbaya menjelaskan mekanisme alamiah dari pertumbuhan ekonomi.\n\nMenurutnya, jika PDB tumbuh lebih cepat maka secara matematis pembagi (denominator) utang menjadi lebih besar, sehingga rasio utang otomatis mengecil. Di sisi lain, eskalasi pertumbuhan ekonomi juga akan mengerek penerimaan pajak.\n\nLebih lanjut, mantan ketua dewan komisioner Lembaga Penjamin Simpanan itu menggarisbawahi bahwa perekonomian yang disetir oleh sektor swasta secara historis menghasilkan tax ratio alias rasio pajak terhadap PDB yang lebih tinggi.\n\nAlasannya, sambung Purbaya, entitas swasta cenderung memiliki keterbatasan dalam meminta berbagai insentif atau potongan pajak dibandingkan dengan proyek-proyek pemerintah. Purbaya membandingkan, rata-rata tax ratio pada era pemerintahan SBY lebih tinggi sekitar 0,5% hingga 1% dibandingkan dengan era Presiden Joko Widodo.\n\n\"Itu saja hampir otomatis. Kalau saya dapat tambahan rasio 0,5% saja dari pertumbuhan ekonomi, saya dapat tambahan penerimaan perpajakan sekitar Rp100 triliun. Jadi ada harapan ke sana selama kita perbaiki ke depannya,\" jelasnya.\n\nUntuk memastikan rasio pajak benar-benar terkerek naik seiring bergeraknya mesin swasta, Kementerian Keuangan juga tengah melakukan pembenahan internal di institusi pengumpul penerimaan negara.\n\nPurbaya menegaskan bahwa pihaknya telah melakukan 'bersih-bersih' organisasi lewat rotasi puluhan pejabat di Direktorat Jenderal Bea dan Cukai dan Direktorat Jenderal Pajak untuk mengoptimalkan kinerja pungutan.\n\nDia pun mengaku optimis strategi memacu swasta bisa membuahkan hasil, berkaca capaian pertumbuhan ekonomi pada kuartal IV/2025 yang sukses menembus 5,39%, lebih tinggi dari kuartal-kuartal sebelumnya.\n\n\"Memang enggak gampang, tapi saya yakin dengan hasil kemarin [di kuartal IV/2025], kayaknya pergerakan kita ke arah sana sudah benar,\" ujar Purbaya.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA - The DPR is currently processing the Draft Third Amendment to Law no. 5 of 1999 concerning Prohibition of Monopolistic Practices and Unfair Business Competition. After a quarter century, this update is an important step in responding to new economic challenges, especially large digital platforms and increasingly complex market structures.\n\nThe DPR is currently processing the Draft Third Amendment to Law no. 5 of 1999 concerning Prohibition of Monopoly Practices and Unfair Business Competition. After a quarter century, this update is an important step in responding to new economic challenges, especially large digital platforms and increasingly complex market structures.\n\nFor the wider community, competition issues may feel far from everyday life. In fact, when unfair competition occurs, the consequences are immediately felt by consumers. Therefore, effective competition law is a prerequisite for a healthy and inclusive economy.\n\nCompetition law is a mix of economics and law. That's why many countries place economic analysis at the heart of modern competition law enforcement. The goal is simple: to protect competition in the public interest, not specific business actors. This law assesses whether a behavior harms consumers and hinders competition. The approach is based on economic impact, and this has become best practice at the global level.\n\nSo the core issue is the quality of law enforcement, not just the content of the text of the law. No matter how good the new law is, it will be dull if it is operated by institutions that are not equipped with adequate evidentiary standards. Revision of Law no. 5/1999 provides an opportunity for Indonesia to align itself with these standards. The success of reform depends not only on the content of the law, but on the way authorities implement it.\n\nSo far, Indonesia has adhered to an integrated enforcement model where one institution (KPPU) acts as investigator, prosecutor and case decider. This model can work well, but requires three main conditions: strong economic competence, clear procedures, and an effective court objection mechanism. Because the KPPU has the same function as investigator and judge, the objection mechanism in court must be strengthened in order to maintain legal certainty.\n\nAlso Read\n\nIn the political economy and legal literature, the quality of competition law enforcement is understood as part of the quality of institutions and governance. This quality is determined not only by the existence of laws, but also by consistency of implementation, procedural transparency, legal certainty, and protection against enforcement errors (especially false positives).\n\nFalse positives about pro-competitive behavior will create a long-term deterrent effect. Business actors, including foreign investors, will avoid jurisdictions that have this risk.\n\nIn the ASEAN context, this effect is strengthened by the fact that investors have many options in the same region. If the risk of false positives in one country is considered high, investors will choose to invest in other Asean countries where law enforcement is more predictable.\n\nCOMPETITION IN ASEAN\n\nWithin the framework of the Asean Economic Community (AEC), foreign investors no longer view Asean countries as independent markets, but as regional investment spaces that compete with each other. They compared the costs, risks and quality of institutions between Asean countries.\n\nConsequently, differences in the quality of competition law enforcement are one of the main differentiating factors in determining the allocation of foreign investment (PMA) in this region. Investors are very sensitive to regulatory uncertainty and competition law enforcement which is considered to exceed reasonable limits. In this context, competition law enforcement is not only an instrument for protecting the domestic market, but also an institutional signal for foreign investors.\n\nIn the Asean region, Vietnam is a country that investors tend to perceive as a more cautious jurisdiction in enforcing competition and pro-investment laws. In contrast, Indonesia is perceived as a jurisdiction with active enforcement but with a higher risk of uncertainty.\n\nCurrently, the number of FDI in Indonesia still beats Vietnam. Our government put a figure of 38.9 trillion U.S. dollars for 2025, while Vietnam recorded a figure of 31.52 trillion U.S. dollars. for the same time period. However, strengthening Vietnam's competition policy will continue to be a pulling factor for FDI, especially in the high-tech sector.\n\nIn many countries, the combination of strong laws and competent authorities has been proven to improve market quality. Therefore, the revision of Law 5/1999 is an important momentum to ensure that Indonesia has competition law that is modern, balanced, and able to respond to the needs of the times. The DPR's steps need to be supported, by strengthening institutional competence, not just the authority of the KPPU. Without that, the big goal of strengthening competition and making the economy healthy will be difficult to realize.\n\nIn the end, healthy business competition belongs to us all. He determines the prices of goods, the quality of services, and business opportunities for the younger generation. This is the time for Indonesia to build a solid competition law foundation, not only on paper, but also in its implementation.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com,JAKARTA - DPR tengah memroses Rancangan Perubahan Ketiga UU No. 5 Tahun 1999 tentang Larangan Praktik Monopoli dan Persaingan Usaha Tidak Sehat. Setelah seperempat abad, pembaruan ini menjadi langkah penting menjawab tantangan ekonomi baru, terutama platform digital besar dan struktur pasar yang makin kompleks.\n\nDPR tengah memroses Rancangan Perubahan Ketiga UU No. 5 Tahun 1999 tentang Larangan Praktik Monopoli danPersaingan UsahaTidak Sehat. Setelah seperempat abad, pembaruan ini menjadi langkah penting menjawab tantangan ekonomi baru, terutama platform digital besar dan struktur pasar yang makin kompleks.\n\nBagi masyarakat luas, isu persaingan mungkin terasa jauh dari keseharian. Padahal, ketika persaingan tidak sehat terjadi, konsekuensinya langsung dirasakan konsumen. Karena itu, hukum persaingan yang efektif menjadi prasyarat ekonomi yang sehat dan inklusif.\n\nHukum persaingan adalah bauran antara ekonomi dan hukum. Itu sebabnya banyak negara menempatkan analisis ekonomi sebagai inti penegakan hukum persaingan modern. Tujuannya sederhana: melindungi persaingan demi kepentingan publik, bukan pelaku usaha tertentu. Hukum ini menilai apakah suatu perilaku merugikan konsumen dan menghambat persaingan. Pendekatannya berbasis dampak ekonomi, dan ini telah menjadi praktik terbaik di tingkat global.\n\nMaka persoalan intinya adalah kualitas penegakan hukum tersebut, bukan sekadar isi teks undang-undang. Sebagus apa pun UU baru nanti, ia akan tumpul jika dioperasikan oleh lembaga yang tidak diperlengkapi standar pembuktian yang memadai. Revisi UU No. 5/1999 memberi kesempatan bagi Indonesia untuk menyelaraskan diri dengan standar tersebut. Keberhasilan reformasi tak hanya bergantung pada isi UU, tetapi pada cara otoritas menjalankannya.\n\nSelama ini, Indonesia menganut model penegakan terintegrasi di mana satu lembaga (KPPU) bertindak sebagai penyelidik, penuntut, sekaligus pemutus perkara. Model ini dapat bekerja dengan baik, tetapi memerlukan tiga syarat utama: kompetensi ekonomi yang kuat, prosedur yang jelas, dan mekanisme keberatan ke pengadilan yang efektif. Karena KPPU merangkap fungsi penyelidik dan pemutus, mekanisme keberatan di pengadilan harus diperkuat demi menjaga kepastian hukum.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nDalam literatur ekonomi politik dan hukum, kualitas penegakan hukum persaingan dipahami sebagai bagian dari kualitas institusi dan tata kelola (governance). Kualitas ini tidak hanya ditentukan oleh keberadaan undang-undang, tetapi juga oleh konsistensi penerapan, transparansi prosedural, kepastian hukum, dan perlindungan terhadap kesalahan penegakan (khususnya false positives).\n\nFalse positives terhadap perilaku pro-persaingan akan menciptakan efek gentar jangka panjang. Pelaku usaha, termasuk investor asing, akan menghindari yurisdiksi yang memiliki risiko ini.\n\nDalam konteks Asean, efek ini diperkuat oleh fakta bahwa investor memiliki banyak opsi di kawasan yang sama. Jika risiko false positives di satu negara dianggap tinggi, investor akan memilih untuk menanamkan modal di negara Asean lain yang penegakan hukumnya lebih dapat diprediksi.\n\nPERSAINGAN DI ASEAN\n\nDalam kerangka Asean Economic Community (AEC), investor asing tidak lagi memandang negara-negara Asean sebagai pasar yang berdiri sendiri, melainkan sebagai ruang investasi regional yang saling bersaing. Mereka membandingkan dengan biaya, risiko, dan kualitas institusi antarnegara Asean.\n\nKonsekuensinya, perbedaan kualitas penegakan hukum persaingan menjadi salah satu faktor pembeda utama dalam penentuan alokasi penanaman modal asing (PMA) di kawasan ini. Investor sangat sensitif terhadap ketidakpastian regulasi dan penegakan hukum persaingan yang dianggap melebihi batas kewajaran. Dalam konteks ini, penegakan hukum persaingan tidak saja menjadi instrumen perlindungan pasar domestik, tetapi juga sebagai sinyal institusional bagi investor asing.\n\nDi kawasan Asean, Vietnam adalah negara yang cenderung dipersepsikan investor sebagai yurisdiksi yang lebih berhati-hati dalam menegakkan hukum persaingan dan pro-investasi. Sebaliknya, Indonesia dipersepsikan sebagai yurisdiksi dengan penegakan aktif tetapi dengan risiko ketidakpastian yang lebih tinggi.\n\nSaat ini, jumlah PMA di Indonesia masih mengalahkan Vietnam. Pemerintah kita menyebutkan angka 38,9 triliun dolar AS untuk tahun 2025, sedangkan Vietnam mencatat angka 31.52 triliun dolar A.S. untuk periode waktu yang sama. Namun, penguatan kebijakan persaingan Vietnam akan terus menjadi faktor penarik PMA, terutama di sektor teknologi tinggi.\n\nDi berbagai negara, kombinasi antara UU yang kuat dan otoritas yang kompeten terbukti meningkatkan kualitas pasar. Oleh karena itu, revisi UU 5/1999 menjadi momentum penting untuk memastikan bahwa Indonesia memiliki hukum persaingan yang modern, berimbang, dan mampu menjawab kebutuhan zaman. Langkah DPR perlu didukung, dengan penguatan kompetensi kelembagaan, bukan sekadar kewenangan KPPU. Tanpa itu, tujuan besar memperkuat persaingan dan menyehatkan ekonomi sulit diwujudkan.\n\nPada akhirnya, persaingan usaha yang sehat adalah milik kita bersama. Ia menentukan harga barang, kualitas layanan, hingga kesempatan usaha generasi muda. Inilah saatnya Indonesia membangun fondasi hukum persaingan yang kokoh, tidak hanya di atas kertas, tetapi juga dalam pelaksanaannya.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA - Approaching Eid Al-Fitr 2026, the disbursement of Holiday Allowances (THR) for Civil Servants (PNS) has once again become a public concern. THR not only helps meet Eid needs, but also plays a role in maintaining people's purchasing power and encouraging national economic turnover.\n\nFor 2026, the THR scheme for civil servants refers to Government Regulation Number 11 of 2025. Although the official amount is still waiting for the government's announcement, the description of the components and calculations can already be predicted based on this regulation.\n\nMinister of Finance Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa confirmed that the 2026 holiday allowance (THR) for ASN, TNI soldiers and Polri members will begin to be disbursed in the first week of Ramadan.

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com,JAKARTA - Menjelang Hari Raya Idulfitri 2026,pencairan Tunjangan Hari Raya(THR) bagi Pegawai Negeri Sipil (PNS) kembali menjadi perhatian publik. THR bukan hanya membantu memenuhi kebutuhanLebaran, tetapi juga berperan menjaga daya beli masyarakat dan mendorong perputaran ekonomi nasional.\n\nUntuk tahun 2026, skema THR PNS mengacu pada Peraturan Pemerintah Nomor 11 Tahun 2025. Meski nominal resminya masih menunggu pengumuman pemerintah, gambaran komponen dan perhitungannya sudah dapat diprediksi berdasarkan regulasi tersebut.\n\nMenteri Keuangan Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa memastikan tunjangan hari raya (THR) 2026 bagi ASN, prajurit TNI, dan anggota Polri mulai dicairkan pada pekan pertama Ramadan. Pemerintah telah menyiapkan anggaran Rp55 triliun yang masuk dalam belanja negara triwulan I 2026 sebesar Rp809 triliun, dengan penyaluran dilakukan di awal puasa untuk menopang daya beli dan menjaga laju pertumbuhan ekonomi.\n\n“Ada pasti nanti (pencairan THR ASN). Tapi, saya tidak tahu tanggal pastinya, yang jelas di awal-awal puasa kita harapkan udah bisa kita salurkan.” ujarnya.\n\nNamun jika mengacu pada pencairan THR pada tahun 2025, dana ditransfer ke rekening penerima 10-15 hari kerja sebelum idulfitri, maka THR PNS 2026 kemungkinan cair pada 4 hingga 9 maret 2026.\n\nBerdasarkan regulasi, penerima THR tidak hanya PNS aktif. Berikut kelompok yang berhak menerima:\n\nBaca Juga\n\nKebijakan ini merupakan bentuk apresiasi negara atas pengabdian aparatur dan pensiunan.\n\nMengacu pada Peraturan Pemerintah Nomor 11 Tahun 2025, THR PNS terdiri dari beberapa komponen utama:\n\nUntuk PNS daerah, THR juga dapat mencakup tambahan penghasilan daerah (TPP) maksimal sebesar penghasilan satu bulan, dengan mempertimbangkan kapasitas fiskal masing-masing daerah. Secara prinsip, THR dibayarkan 100 persen tanpa potongan iuran.\n\nPerhitungan THR ASN umumnya mengacu pada masa kerja:\n\nSkema ini memastikan ASN yang baru diangkat tetap memperoleh hak secara proporsional.\n\nBeberapa kelompok ASN memiliki skema berbeda:\n\nGuru yang tidak menerima tunjangan kinerja berhak memperoleh THR berupa tunjangan profesi guru atau tambahan penghasilan guru ASN, maksimal setara satu bulan.\n\nDosen yang tidak menerima tukin berhak atas tunjangan profesi dosen atau tunjangan kehormatan profesor sesuai ketentuan.\n\nCPNS menerima:\n\nTidak semua tunjangan dihitung dalam THR. Beberapa yang dikecualikan antara lain:\n\nPemberian THR memiliki beberapa tujuan strategis:\n\nDengan dasar hukum yang jelas, kebijakan THR PNS 2026 diharapkan memberikan kepastian dan manfaat nyata bagi seluruh penerima.

This figure decreased to IDR 82.9 trillion at the January 20 auction, fell again to IDR 76.58 trillion at the February 3 auction, and finally reached IDR 63.06 trillion at the February 18 2026 auction.\n\nReflecting on the last auction, the Director General of Financing and Risk Management at the Ministry of Finance, Suminto, believes that investor interest is still relatively solid even though nominal bids have decreased. He highlighted that the supply contraction was most pronounced in short tenor instruments.\n\n\"The decrease in incoming bids mainly came from short tenor SPN [State Treasury Letters], in line with banking strategies in anticipating liquidity needs ahead of Eid,\" he said, Thursday (19/2/2026).\n\nApart from domestic factors, Suminto said that global market conditions which were still in the atmosphere of the Chinese New Year celebration holiday in several financial centers such as Singapore and Hong Kong also influenced the volume of incoming offers.\n\nAlso Read\n\nOf the total incoming bid of IDR 63.06 trillion at the February 18 auction, the government decided to absorb funds amounting to IDR 40.00 trillion.\n\nIn more detail, investor demand was observed to be highly concentrated in medium tenor instruments. The 5 year and 10 year series dominate the market with recorded incoming bids of IDR 24.16 trillion and IDR 21.07 trillion respectively.\n\nSuminto believes that this development indicates a strong investor preference for tenors that are liquid and act as benchmarks in the secondary market.\n\nIn terms of profile, Suminto explained that domestic investors, especially the banking sector, still dominate the portion of auction winners. In the midst of the Chinese New Year holiday, he also highlighted that foreign investors continued to register participation with an absorption portion of around 15.50% of the total bids won.\n\n\"[The participation of foreign investors] reflects confidence in Indonesia's economic fundamentals and the credibility of fiscal management,\" said the subordinate of Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa.\n\nAs for borrowing costs, the government claims that the yield, aka auction returns, is relatively stable. Suminto claims that the increase in weighted average yield is still very limited when compared with previous SUN auctions, even though the auction was held after a revision of the outlook by the rating agency Moody's.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA – Indications of a decline in investor interest in the auction of Government Debt Securities, aka SUN, cast a shadow over the debt financing target of the 2026 State Revenue and Expenditure Budget, aka APBN, worth IDR 832.2 trillion.\n\nHowever, amidst the large need for budget financing, the Ministry of Finance (Kemenkeu) actually noted that the number of incoming bids in 4 debt securities auctions continued to decline.\n\nDuring the auction period on January 6 2026, for example, the government recorded that the total incoming bids still reached IDR 90.96 trillion. This figure fell to IDR 82.9 trillion at the auction on January 20 2026, fell again to IDR 76.58 trillion on February 3 2026, and most recently on February 18 2026 it decreased to IDR 63.06 trillion.\n\nThis condition is inversely proportional to the realization of the SUN auction in early 2025 which saw incoming bids growing over the next three auctions. At the first SUN auction in 2025, the government collected IDR 31.65 trillion and tended to grow until Tuesday (18/2/2025) raising funds worth IDR 84 trillion.\n\nHowever, the Director General of Financing and Risk Management (DJPPR) of the Ministry of Finance, Suminto, stated that the number of offers or incoming bids at the auction on February 18 2026 still reflects fairly solid demand conditions amidst global market conditions which are still celebrating Chinese New Year in several countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\n\"Investor demand is still concentrated in medium tenors, especially the 5 year and 10 year series which recorded incoming bids of IDR 24.16 trillion and IDR 21.07 trillion respectively. This shows investors' preference for liquid tenors and has become a benchmark in the secondary market,\" said Suminto to Bisnis, Thursday (19/2/2026).\n\nAlso Read\n\nSuminto also explained that domestic investor participation remained strong, especially the banking sector which dominated the share of auction winners.\n\nOn the other hand, even though several financial markets are on holiday, interest from foreign investors also remains high. The number of winning bids from foreign investors was around 15.50% of the total won. \"This reflects confidence in Indonesia's economic fundamentals and the credibility of fiscal management.\"\n\nApart from that, even though incoming bids have decreased compared to previous SUN auctions, continued Suminto, the yield or return requested by investors is still quite competitive. According to him, the decline in incoming bids, especially from short tenor SPNs, occurred in line with banking strategies in anticipating liquidity needs ahead of Eid.\n\n\"In terms of costs, the auction yield was relatively maintained with an increase in the weighted average yield which remained limited compared to the previous SUN auction, even though it took place after the outlook revision by Moody's. \"This reflects investor confidence which remains solid in the fundamentals of the domestic financial market,\" he stressed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Finance (Kemenkeu) noted a decrease in bids or incoming bids for Government Debt Letters aka SUN in the auction which took place on Wednesday (18/2/2026) yesterday.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance noted that the number of bids entered in yesterday's auction reached IDR 63.06 trillion or a decrease of around 17.6% from the auction period on February 3 2026 which reached IDR 76.58 trillion. This figure is also much smaller than the bid at the January 20 2026 auction of IDR 82.9 trillion.\n\nAccording to the official website of the Directorate General of Financing and Risk Management (DJPPR) of the Ministry of Finance (Kemenkeu), the number of debt securities auctioned last Wednesday included 9 series, namely SPN01260322 (new issuance), SPN03260521 (new issuance), SPN12270204 (reopening), FR0109 (reopening), FR0108 (reopening), FR0106 (reopening), FR0107 (reopening), FR0102 (reopening) and FR0105 (reopening).\n\nIf detailed, the total bids received for the SPN01260322 series reached IDR 700 billion, SPN03260521 IDR 300 billion, SPN12270204 IDR 4.77 trillion, FR0109 IDR 24.16 trillion, FR0108 IDR 21.07 trillion, FR0106 IDR 4.33 trillion, FR0107 IDR 3.29 trillion, FR0102 Rp. 2.23 tri liun, and FR0105 IDR 2.18 trillion.\n\nDue to sluggish bidding, Minister of Finance Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa finally increased the auction amount for winning debt securities, which was initially targeted at IDR 33 trillion to IDR 40 trillion. The auction results were also higher compared to the auction period on February 3 2026, which was only IDR 36 trillion.\n\nThe decline in offers occurred in the majority of debt securities except the Fixed Rate series or FR0108, where the total offer reached IDR 21.07 trillion.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Treasury Letter series or SPN12270204 with a weighted average yield of 4.48%, for example, which at the auction on February 3 2026 was able to record a bid of IDR 6.92 trillion at the auction on February 18 2026 fell to IDR 4.77 trillion.\n\nSimilar conditions also occurred in the Fixed Rate or FR series with yields in the range of 5.67% - 6.77%, the FR0109 series offer fell from IDR 25.39 trillion to IDR 24.16 trillion, FR0106 fell from IDR 8.93 trillion to IDR 4.33 trillion, FR0107 from IDR 4.13 trillion to IDR 3.29 trillion, FR0102 which was originally IDR 3.78 trillion became IDR 2.23 trillion, and the FR0105 series decreased from IDR 34.74 trillion to IDR 2.18 trillion.\n\nMounting geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran are considered to be one of the causes of increasingly sluggish market demand in the auction of Government Debt Securities (SUN) throughout 2026.\n\nHead of Fixed Income Anugerah Sekuritas Indonesia, Ramdhan Ario Maruto, believes that increasingly mounting geopolitical tensions have discouraged foreign investors from investing in Indonesia through SUN instruments.\n\n\"If foreigners leave, psychologically this indicates that they will go down because they are aggressive. Domestic will usually follow too. For yesterday's decline, foreigners left. That will make domestic ones come too,\" he said to Business, Monday (16/2/2026).\n\nInevitably, geopolitical instability has also led DJPPR to issue more short-tenor SUN. Compared to 2025, State Treasury Letters (SPN) are usually issued 2 times and this has increased to 3 times this year.\n\nMarket uptake is no less large for SPN. \"In the latest SUN issuance, for example, the three SPN tenors received market absorption worth Rp. 11.98 trillion, greater than the actual absorption of Rp. 8.56 trillion at the last auction in 2025. \"This short tenor is due to the previous uncertainty. So the risk is longer, volatility is usually higher. The potential for price corrections and yield changes is also greater. Indeed, market demand is higher in the short term because current conditions are unstable,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, KB Valbury Sekuritas Economist Fikri C. Permana believes that the increasingly sluggish market uptake of SUN auctions recently is more due to domestic macroeconomic conditions. Fikri highlighted the 2025 APBN deficit and state tax revenues which tend to be low.\n\nDomestic conditions like this make investors ask for a higher risk premium for government-issued debt securities. \"This means there is concern, perhaps the data is not in line. Indonesia's capacity is decreasing over time. This is what makes the market, I think it's not only Moody's that is asking for a higher yield, but all investors. That's why demand for SBN is lower,\" he said to Bisnis, Monday (16/2/2026).\n\nMeanwhile, the consistent realization of sukuk auction bids is at a level of around IDR 50 trillion - IDR 40 trillion, which is thought to be more due to the niche market for sharia products. That way, this product will continue to receive stable offers from investors.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA – Indikasi penurunan minat investor dalam lelang Surat Utang Negara alias SUN membayangi target pembiayaan utang Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara alias APBN 2026 senilai Rp832,2 triliun.\n\nNamun di tengah besarnya kebutuhan pembiayaan anggaran, Kementerian Keuangan (Kemenkeu) justru mencatat bahwa jumlah penawaran yang masuk (incoming bids) dalam 4 kali lelang surat utang terus mengalami penurunan.\n\nPada periode lelang 6 Januari 2026 lalu, misalnya, pemerintah mencatat total penawaran yang masuk masih menembus angka Rp90,96 triliun. Angka ini turun menjadi Rp82,9 triliun pada lelang 20 Januari 2026, turun lagi ke Rp76,58 triliun pada 3 Februari 2026, dan yang terakhir pada 18 Februari 2026 kemarin menyusut ke angka Rp63,06 triliun.\n\nKondisi ini berbanding terbalik dengan realisasi lelang SUN pada awal 2025 yang menorehkan penawaran masuk yang bertumbuh hingga tiga lelang selanjutnya. Pada lelang SUN perdana 2025, pemerintah menghimpun dana Rp31,65 triliun dan cenderung tumbuh hingga Selasa (18/2/2025) menghimpun dana senilai Rp84 triliun.\n\nMeski demikian, Direktur Jenderal Pengelolaan Pembiayaan dan Risiko (DJPPR) Kemenkeu Suminto mengemukakan bahwa jumlah penawaran atauincoming bidspada lelang 18 Februari 2026 masih mencerminkan kondisi permintaan yang cukup solid di tengah kondisi pasar global yang masih merayakan Imlek di beberapa negara seperti  Singapura, dan Hong Kong.\n\n“Permintaan investor masih terkonsentrasi pada tenor menengah, khususnya seri 5 tahun dan 10 tahun yang mencatat incoming bids masing-masing sebesar Rp24,16 triliun dan Rp21,07 triliun. Hal ini menunjukkan preferensi investor terhadap tenor yang likuid dan menjadi benchmark di pasar sekunder,: kata Suminto kepadaBisnis, Kamis (19/2/2026).\n\nBaca Juga\n\nSuminto juga menjelaskan bahwa partisipasi investor domestik tetap kuat, terutama sektor perbankan yang mendominasi porsi pemenang lelang.\n\nDi sisi lain walaupun beberapa pasar keuangan libur, minat investor asing juga tetap tinggi. Jumlah penawaran yang dimenangkanawarded bidsdari investor asing sekitar 15,50% dari total dimenangkan. “Hal ini mencerminkan kepercayaan terhadap fundamental ekonomi Indonesia dan kredibilitas pengelolaan fiskal.”\n\nSelain itu, meskipunincoming bidsmenurun dibandingkan dengan lelang SUN sebelumnya, lanjut Suminto,yieldatau imbal hasil yang diminta investor masih cukup kompetitif. Menurutnya, penurunanincoming bidsterutama berasal dari SPN tenor pendek terjadi seiring strategi perbankan dalam mengantisipasi kebutuhan likuiditas menjelang Lebaran.\n\n“Dari sisi biaya,yieldhasil lelang relatif terjaga dengan kenaikanweighted average yieldyang tetap terbatas dibandingkan lelang SUN sebelumnya, meskipun berlangsung setelah revisioutlookoleh Moody’s. Hal ini mencerminkan kepercayaan investor yang tetap solid terhadap fundamental pasar keuangan domestik,” tegasnya.\n\nAdapun Kementerian Keuangan (Kemenkeu) mencatat adanya penurunan penawaran atauincoming bidsSurat Utang Negara alias SUN dalam lelang yang berlangsung pada Rabu (18/2/2026) kemarin.\n\nKemenkeu mencatat jumlah penawaran yang masuk dalam lelang kemarin mencapai Rp63,06 triliun atau turun sekitar 17,6% dari periode lelang 3 Februari 2026 yang mencapai Rp76,58 triliun. Angka itu juga menyusut jauh dibandingkan penawaran pada lelang 20 Januari 2026 senilai Rp82,9 triliun.\n\nMelansir laman resmi Direktorat Jenderal Pengelolaan Pembiayaan dan Risiko (DJPPR) Kementerian Keuangan (Kemenkeu), jumlah surat utang dilelang pada Rabu kemarin mencakup 9 seri yakni SPN01260322 (new issuance), SPN03260521 (new issuance), SPN12270204 (reopening), FR0109 (reopening), FR0108 (reopening), FR0106 (reopening), FR0107 (reopening), FR0102 (reopening) dan FR0105 (reopening).\n\nAdapun jika dirinci, total penawaran yang masuk untuk seri SPN01260322 mencapai Rp700 miliar, SPN03260521 Rp300 miliar, SPN12270204 Rp4,77 triliun, FR0109 Rp24,16 triliun, FR0108 Rp21,07 triliun, FR0106 Rp4,33 triliun, FR0107 Rp3,29 triliun, FR0102 Rp2,23 triliun, dan FR0105 Rp2,18 triliun.\n\nAkibat lesunya penawaran, Menteri Keuangan Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa pun akhirnya menaikkan jumlah penetapan lelang surat utang yang dimenangkan yang awalnya ditarget senilai Rp33 triliun menjadi Rp40 triliun. Penetapan hasil lelang itu juga lebih tinggi dibandingkan periode lelang 3 Februari 2026 lalu, yang hanya sebesar Rp36 triliun.\n\nPenurunan penawaran itu terjadi di mayoritas surat utang kecuali seriFix Rateatau FR0108 yang jumlah penawarannya mencapai Rp21,07 triliun.\n\nSementara itu, seri Surat Perbendaharaan Negara atau SPN12270204 dengan yield rata-rata tertimbang 4,48%, misalnya, yang pada lelang 3 Februari 2026 mampu membukukan penawaran sebesar Rp6,92 triliun pada lelang 18 Februari 2026 turun menjadi Rp4,77 triliun.\n\nKondisi serupa juga terjadi pada seriFix Rateatau FR denganyielddi kisaran 5,67%-6,77%, penawaran seri FR0109 turun dari Rp25,39 triliun menjadi Rp24,16 triliun, FR0106 turun dari Rp8,93 triliun menjadi Rp4,33 triliun, FR0107 dari Rp4,13 triliun ke Rp3,29 triliun, FR0102 yang semula Rp3,78 triliun menjadi  Rp2,23 triliun, serta seri FR0105 turun dari Rp34,74 triliun menjadi Rp2,18 triliun.\n\nKetegangan geopolitik yang memuncak antara AS dan Iran dinilai menjadi salah satu penyebab kian lesunya permintaan pasar dalam lelang Surat Utang Negara (SUN) sepanjang 2026.\n\nHead of Fixed Income Anugerah Sekuritas Indonesia Ramdhan Ario Maruto, menilai ketegangan geopolitik yang kian memuncak telah menyurutkan minat investor asing untuk berinvestasi di Tanah Air melalui instrumen SUN.\n\n”Kalau asing keluar, secara psikologis ini menandakan akan turun karena mereka agresif. Domestik biasanya akan mengikuti juga. Untuk penurunan kemarin, asing sempat keluar. Itu akan membuat yang domestik ikut juga,” katanya kepadaBisnis, Senin (16/2/2026).\n\nTak pelak, ketidakstabilan geopolitik turut membuat DJPPR menerbitkan lebih banyak SUN bertenor pendek. Dibandingkan dengan 2025, Surat Perbendaharaan Negara (SPN) biasanya diterbitkan sebanyak 2 kali dan bertambah menjadi 3 kali pada tahun ini.\n\nSerapan pasar tidak kalah besar terhadap SPN. Pada penerbitan SUN teranyar misalnya, tiga tenor SPN mendapatkan serapan pasar senilai Rp11,98 triliun, lebih besar ketimbang realisasi penyerapan senilai Rp8,56 triliun pada lelang terakhir 2025. ”Tenor pendek ini karenauncertaintadi. Jadi risikonya semakin panjang, biasanya volatilitas lebih tinggi. Potensi koreksi harga, perubahanyieldjuga lebih besar. Memang kebutuhan pasarnya lebih tinggi di jangka pendek karena memang kondisi sekarang tidak stabil,” tambahnya.\n\nSementara itu, Ekonom KB Valbury Sekuritas Fikri C. Permana menilai kian lesunya serapan pasar terhadap lelang SUN belakangan lebih disebabkan oleh kondisi makroekonomi dalam negeri. Fikri menyoroti ihwal defisit APBN 2025 hingga penerimaan pajak negara yang cenderung rendah.\n\nKondisi dalam negeri seperti ini, membuat investor meminta risk premi yang lebih terhadap surat utang terbitan negara. ”Artinya ada kekhawatiran, jangan-jangan datanya tidak sejalan. Kemampuan dari Indonesia makin lama kok makin turun. Ini yang membuat marketnya, saya pikir tidak hanya Moody’s yang minta yield yang lebih besar, tapi semua investor. Makanya permintaan terhadap SBN lebih rendah,” katanya kepada Bisnis, Senin (16/2/2026).\n\nSementara itu, realisasi penawaran lelang sukuk yang konsisten berada pada level sekitar Rp50 triliun—Rp40 triliun, dinilai lebih disebabkan olehmarket nicheproduk syariah itu. Dengan begitu, produk ini akan secara tetap mendapatkan penawaran yang stabil dari investor.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — The Association of Indonesian Food and Beverage Entrepreneurs (Gapmmi) assesses that Indonesia needs a clear roadmap to reduce dependence on imported raw materials for the food and beverage industry (mamin).\n\nGeneral Chairman of Gapmmi Adhi S. Lukman said that high dependence is considered to make the industry vulnerable to fluctuations in the rupiah exchange rate and the dynamics of global trade policies.\n\nMoreover, until now most of the main raw materials for the food and beverage industry still come from abroad. In fact, this sector is expected to be one of the pillars of national economic growth, including a growth target of up to 8%.\n\n\"We want to absorb it from within the country, but upstream developments are slower than industrial needs, so we are increasingly lagging behind and need more and more imported raw materials,\" said Adhi to Bisnis, Thursday (19/2/2026).\n\nHe explained that strict import regulations such as prohibitions and restrictions (lartas) had good intentions. However, without synchronization with industry needs, these regulations have the potential to hamper production, especially when domestic supplies are inadequate.\n\nAccording to Adhi, the solution needed is not just a relaxation of regulations, but an integrated short and long term road map between upstream and downstream sectors. The roadmap is expected to contain a strategy for the next five to ten years to strengthen domestic raw material production capacity.\n\nAlso Read\n\n\"We need to make a clear roadmap, five years to where, ten years to where. The important thing is that we have to support upstream development so that we can gradually reduce dependence on imports,\" he said.\n\nGapmmi data shows that a number of strategic commodities are still very dependent on imports. For the food industry, almost 100% of sugar is still imported, 100% of wheat, around 80% of milk, 90% of food corn, and around 70% of soybeans. Meanwhile, industrial salt is still around 70% dependent on foreign supplies.\n\nThis condition is considered worrying, especially when industry is encouraged to grow higher to support national economic expansion. Gapmmi emphasized that the industry is ready to contribute, as long as support for the availability of raw materials, logistics and infrastructure can be ensured.\n\n\"If industry is told to grow high to support 8% economic growth, we are ready. But industrial resources must be provided, both raw materials, logistics and infrastructure,\" he stressed.\n\nIn the future, Gapmmi also warned of the potential for disruption to the supply of food commodities such as milk, eggs and chicken if there are no coordinated strategic steps. Without a comprehensive and implementable roadmap, it is feared that import dependence will deepen and become a recurring polemic every year.",

Lukman mengatakan ketergantungan yang tinggi dinilai membuat industri rentan terhadap fluktuasi nilai tukar rupiah serta dinamika kebijakan perdagangan global.\n\nApalagi, hingga kini sebagian besar bahan baku utama industri mamin masih berasal dari luar negeri. Padahal, sektor ini diharapkan menjadi salah satu penopang pertumbuhan ekonomi nasional, termasuk target pertumbuhan hingga 8%.\n\n“Kita ingin menyerap dari dalam negeri, tapi perkembangan di hulu lebih lambat dibandingkan kebutuhan industri, sehingga kita makin tertinggal dan makin banyak butuh bahan baku impor,” kata Adhi kepada Bisnis, Kamis (19/2/2026).\n\nDia menjelaskan, regulasi impor yang ketat seperti larangan dan pembatasan (lartas) memang bertujuan baik. Namun, tanpa sinkronisasi dengan kebutuhan industri, aturan tersebut berpotensi menghambat produksi, terutama ketika pasokan dalam negeri belum memadai.\n\nMenurut Adhi, solusi yang dibutuhkan bukan sekadar pelonggaran aturan, melainkan peta jalan jangka pendek dan panjang yang terintegrasi antara sektor hulu dan hilir. Roadmap tersebut diharapkan memuat strategi lima hingga sepuluh tahun ke depan untuk memperkuat kapasitas produksi bahan baku domestik.\n\nBaca Juga\n\n“Kita perlu bikin roadmap yang jelas, lima tahun ke mana, sepuluh tahun ke mana. Yang penting kita harus mendukung perkembangan hulunya supaya secara bertahap bisa mengurangi ketergantungan impor,” tuturnya.\n\nData Gapmmi menunjukkan sejumlah komoditas strategis masih sangat bergantung pada impor. Untuk industri makanan, gula hampir 100% masih diimpor, gandum 100%, susu sekitar 80%, jagung pangan 90%, serta kedelai sekitar 70%. Sementara itu, garam industri masih sekitar 70% bergantung pada pasokan luar negeri.\n\nKondisi tersebut dinilai mengkhawatirkan, terlebih ketika industri didorong untuk tumbuh lebih tinggi demi mendukung ekspansi ekonomi nasional. Gapmmi menegaskan industri siap berkontribusi, asalkan dukungan ketersediaan bahan baku, logistik, dan infrastruktur dapat dipastikan.\n\n“Kalau industri disuruh tumbuh tinggi untuk mendukung pertumbuhan ekonomi 8%, kita siap. Tapi harus disediakan sumber daya industrinya, baik bahan baku, logistik, maupun infrastruktur,” tegasnya.\n\nKe depan, Gapmmi juga mengingatkan potensi gangguan pasokan komoditas pangan seperti susu, telur, dan ayam jika tidak ada langkah strategis yang terkoordinasi. Tanpa roadmap yang komprehensif dan implementatif, ketergantungan impor dikhawatirkan semakin dalam dan berulang menjadi polemik setiap tahun.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Federal Reserve (The Fed) officials showed a more cautious attitude towards cutting interest rates at their policy meeting last month. Some even indicate the Fed may need to raise interest rates again if inflation remains high.\n\nThe minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting 27–28 January 2026 quoted on Thursday (19/2/2026) show that the majority of officials are not considering increasing interest rates in the near future.\n\nHowever, the document confirms that the Fed is increasingly moving away from the consensus to cut interest rates again.\n\nThe development has the potential to fuel tensions with President Donald Trump and could complicate the task of his preferred Fed chairman, Kevin Warsh.\n\nTrump has repeatedly expressed his desire for the next head of the Fed to lower interest rates. Two days after the policy meeting, on January 30, Trump announced the nomination of Warsh—former Governor of the Fed—to replace Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May.\n\n\"The minutes have a more hawkish bent. This creates an interesting dynamic if and when Kevin Warsh is confirmed as chairman of the Fed,\" wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, quoted from Bloomberg.\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said the latest, more positive price data was evidence that inflation was now cooling and stabilizing thanks to Trump's policies that boosted the supply side of the economy.\n\n\"It's time for the Fed to recognize this very clear reality and cut interest rates to provide further relief for American homebuyers and businesses,\" he said.\n\nThe minutes also showed a majority of FOMC members assessed last year's labor market weakness—which prompted the central bank to cut interest rates three times by the end of 2025—starting to ease in late January.\n\n\"The vast majority of participants assessed the downside risk to employment as having reduced in recent months, while the risk of more persistent inflation remains,\" the minutes said.\n\nThat view came before the release of a strong January jobs report. In fact, a group of policy makers at the meeting took a firmer stance in rejecting additional easing.\n\n\"Several participants warned that further policy easing amidst still high inflation could be misinterpreted as weakening policymakers' commitment to the 2% inflation target,\" the minutes read.\n\nHowever, a number of other officials are still open to further cuts in interest rates if inflation falls according to expectations, although most believe that the process of reducing inflation could be slower than expected.\n\nAt its January meeting, the FOMC voted 10-2 to maintain the benchmark federal funds rate in the range of 3.5%–3.75%. Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran dissented and supported a cut of 25 basis points. The committee also removed a phrase that had previously highlighted increasing downside risks to the labor market.\n\nSince the meeting, a number of data show that US economic growth is strengthening, inflation is slowing, and the labor market is stable. The consumer price index (CPI) in January rose modestly, held back by falling energy costs, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, core inflation—which excludes food and energy components—rose according to monthly expectations.\n\nNonfarm payrolls in January recorded their biggest increase in more than a year, while the unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to 4.3%, signaling a stabilization of the job market in early 2026. Data showed the addition of 130,000 jobs in the month.\n\nA number of Fed officials emphasized that the relatively stable US economic conditions provide room for the central bank to be patient before adjusting interest rates further. However, Trump and his administration officials continue to push for it interest rates were immediately reduced.\n\nIn financial markets, market players are starting to reduce expectations on the timing of the next cut, although the federal funds futures contract still indicates a chance of a cut in June.\n\nAt the same meeting, the committee also unanimously re-elected Jerome Powell as Chair of the FOMC and filled a number of other positions until the next election at the first scheduled meeting in 2027.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Pejabat Federal Reserve (The Fed) menunjukkan sikap yang lebih berhati-hati terhadap pemangkasan suku bunga dalam pertemuan kebijakan bulan lalu. Beberapa di antaranya bahkan mengindikasikan The Fed mungkin perlu kembali menaikkan suku bunga jika inflasi tetap tinggi.\n\nRisalah rapat Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 27–28 Januari 2026 yang dikutip pada Kamis (19/2/2026) memperlihatkan bahwa mayoritas pejabat belum mempertimbangkan kenaikan suku bunga dalam waktu dekat.\n\nNamun, dokumen tersebut menegaskan bahwa The Fed semakin menjauh dari konsensus untuk kembali memangkas suku bunga.\n\nPerkembangan ini berpotensi memicu ketegangan dengan Presiden Donald Trump dan dapat mempersulit tugas calon ketua The Fed pilihannya, Kevin Warsh.\n\nTrump berulang kali menyatakan keinginannya agar pimpinan The Fed berikutnya menurunkan suku bunga. Dua hari setelah pertemuan kebijakan tersebut, tepatnya pada 30 Januari, Trump mengumumkan pencalonan Warsh—mantan Gubernur The Fed—untuk menggantikan Jerome Powell yang masa jabatannya berakhir pada Mei.\n\n“Risalah ini memiliki kecenderungan yang lebihhawkish. Hal ini menciptakan dinamika menarik jika dan ketika Kevin Warsh dikonfirmasi sebagai ketua The Fed,” tulis Gregory Daco, kepala ekonom EY-Parthenon dikutip dariBloomberg.\n\nJuru Bicara Gedung Putih Kush Desai menyatakan data harga terbaru yang lebih positif menjadi bukti bahwa inflasi kini mendingin dan stabil berkat kebijakan Trump yang mendorong sisi penawaran ekonomi.\n\n“Sudah saatnya The Fed mengakui realitas yang sangat jelas ini dan memangkas suku bunga untuk memberikan keringanan lebih lanjut bagi pembeli rumah dan pelaku usaha Amerika,” ujarnya.\n\nRisalah juga menunjukkan mayoritas anggota FOMC menilai pelemahan pasar tenaga kerja tahun lalu—yang mendorong bank sentral memangkas suku bunga tiga kali pada akhir 2025—mulai mereda pada akhir Januari.\n\n“Mayoritas besar peserta menilai risiko penurunan terhadap lapangan kerja telah berkurang dalam beberapa bulan terakhir, sementara risiko inflasi yang lebih persisten tetap ada,” demikian isi risalah tersebut.\n\nPandangan itu muncul sebelum rilis laporan ketenagakerjaan Januari yang kuat. Bahkan, sekelompok pembuat kebijakan dalam pertemuan tersebut mengambil sikap yang lebih tegas menolak tambahan pelonggaran.\n\n“Beberapa peserta mengingatkan bahwa pelonggaran kebijakan lebih lanjut di tengah inflasi yang masih tinggi dapat disalahartikan sebagai melemahnya komitmen pembuat kebijakan terhadap target inflasi 2%,” tulis risalah.\n\nMeski demikian, sejumlah pejabat lainnya masih membuka ruang untuk pemangkasan suku bunga lanjutan jika inflasi turun sesuai ekspektasi, walaupun sebagian besar menilai proses penurunan inflasi bisa berlangsung lebih lambat dari perkiraan.\n\nDalam pertemuan Januari, FOMC memutuskan dengan suara 10-2 untuk mempertahankan suku bunga acuanfederal fundsdi kisaran 3,5%–3,75%. Gubernur Christopher Waller dan Stephen Miran berbeda pendapat dan mendukung pemangkasan sebesar 25 basis poin. Komite juga menghapus frasa yang sebelumnya menyoroti meningkatnya risiko penurunan pada pasar tenaga kerja.\n\nSejak pertemuan tersebut, sejumlah data menunjukkan pertumbuhan ekonomi AS menguat, inflasi melambat, dan pasar tenaga kerja stabil. Indeks harga konsumen (CPI) pada Januari naik moderat, tertahan oleh penurunan biaya energi, menurut data Biro Statistik Tenaga Kerja AS. Sementara itu, inflasi inti—yang tidak memasukkan komponen makanan dan energi—naik sesuai ekspektasi bulanan.\n\nNonfarm payrolls pada Januari mencatat kenaikan terbesar dalam lebih dari setahun, sementara tingkat pengangguran turun tak terduga menjadi 4,3%, menandakan stabilisasi pasar kerja di awal 2026. Data menunjukkan penambahan 130.000 lapangan kerja pada bulan tersebut.\n\nSejumlah pejabat The Fed menegaskan kondisi ekonomi AS yang relatif stabil memberi ruang bagi bank sentral untuk bersabar sebelum menyesuaikan suku bunga lebih lanjut. Namun, Trump dan pejabat pemerintahannya terus mendesak agar suku bunga segera diturunkan.\n\nDi pasar keuangan, pelaku pasar mulai mengurangi ekspektasi waktu pemangkasan berikutnya, meskipun kontrak berjangka federal funds masih mengindikasikan peluang pemangkasan pada Juni.\n\nDalam pertemuan yang sama, komite juga secara bulat kembali memilih Jerome Powell sebagai Ketua FOMC serta mengisi sejumlah posisi lainnya hingga pemilihan berikutnya pada rapat terjadwal pertama pada 2027.",

This confirms the lack of good faith in complying with the law. Therefore, today we ask the Central Jakarta District Court to immediately carry out constating and issue an Execution Order for Vacation,\" said Kharis in a written statement, Thursday (19/2/2026).\n\nKharis emphasized that the state will no longer tolerate various maneuvers aimed at delaying land handover. The submission of the execution request letter is the state's final effort to save state assets in the Gelora Bung Karno area which has so far been managed by private parties without a valid legal basis.\n\nAlso Read\n\nIn terms of law, the government stated that the new lawsuits filed by Indobuildco could not delay the execution.\n\nMeanwhile, this refers to civil decision Number 208/Pdt.G/2025 which is immediate or uitvoerbaar bij voorraad, so that the decision can still be implemented even if there are other legal remedies.\n\n\"The rule of law must not be defeated by repeated litigation strategies. The state has the right to take back what belongs to the people,\" added Kharis.\n\nPreviously, PT Indobuildco, which currently still manages the Sultan Hotel, confirmed that it maintained control of the land in Block 15 of the Gelora Bung Karno (GBK) area even though there had been an order to vacate it.\n\nPT Indobuildco's attorney, Hamdan Zoelva, said that currently the case related to land management rights is still in the appeal stage at the Jakarta High Court (PT).\n\nIn line with this, his party asked PPKGBK to respect the ongoing litigation process before taking physical action in the field.\n\n\"This case is still in the appeals process at PT Jakarta. Therefore, GBK has been asked to wait for the ongoing legal process. There is a risk of significant state loss if GBK insists on requesting vacation even though the judicial process and legal efforts are ongoing,\" said Hamdan Zoelva to Bisnis, Sunday (8/2/2026).",

Hal ini menegaskan ketiadaan itikad baik untuk mematuhi hukum. Oleh karena itu, hari ini kami meminta Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat untuk segera melakukan konstatering dan menerbitkan Perintah Eksekusi Pengosongan,” ujar Kharis dalam keterangan tertulis, Kamis (19/2/2026).\n\nKharis menegaskan bahwa negara tidak akan lagi memberikan toleransi terhadap berbagai manuver yang bertujuan untuk mengulur waktu penyerahan lahan. Penyerahan surat permohonan eksekusi ini menjadi upaya final negara dalam menyelamatkan aset negara di kawasan Gelora Bung Karno yang selama ini dikelola oleh pihak swasta tanpa dasar hukum yang sah.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nDalam kaitan hukum, pemerintah menyatakan bahwa gugatan-gugatan baru yang diajukan oleh pihak Indobuildco tidak dapat menunda pelaksanaan eksekusi.\n\nAdapun, hal tersebut merujuk pada putusan perdata Nomor 208/Pdt.G/2025 yang bersifat serta-merta atau uitvoerbaar bij voorraad, sehingga putusan tetap dapat dijalankan meskipun ada upaya hukum lain.\n\n“Supremasi hukum tidak boleh kalah oleh strategi litigasi yang berulang. Negara berhak mengambil kembali apa yang menjadi milik rakyat,” tambah Kharis.\n\nSebelumnya, PT Indobuildco yang saat ini masih mengelola Hotel Sultan, memastikan tetap mempertahankan penguasaan lahan di Blok 15 Kawasan Gelora Bung Karno (GBK) meskipun telah ada perintah pengosongan.\n\nKuasa Hukum PT Indobuildco Hamdan Zoelva mengatakan, saat ini perkara terkait hak pengelolaan lahan tersebut masih dalam tahap upaya banding di Pengadilan Tinggi (PT) Jakarta.\n\nSejalan dengan hal itu, pihaknya meminta PPKGBK untuk menghormati proses litigasi yang sedang berlangsung sebelum mengambil tindakan fisik di lapangan.\n\n\"Perkara ini masih proses upaya banding di PT Jakarta. Karena itu diminta kepada GBK untuk menunggu proses hukum yang sedang berjalan. Ada risiko kerugian negara yang cukup besar jika GBK memaksa untuk meminta pengosongan padahal proses peradilan dan upaya hukum sedang berjalan,\" ujar Hamdan Zoelva kepadaBisnis, Minggu (8/2/2026).",

Melalui rangkaian program mulai dari konten edukatif, aktivasi digital dan promo interaktif, kegiatan berbagi takjil di area stasiun, hingga inisiatif sosial seperti buka puasa bersama anak yatim-piatu dan penyandang disabilitas.\n\nMRT juga membuka donasi publik, penyaluran paket berkah Ramadan, serta mengajak masyarakat untuk tidak sekadar bergerak dari satu stasiun ke stasiun lain, tetapi juga melangkah bersama dalam semangat berbagi, kepedulian, dan kebersamaan selama Ramadan.\n\nSaat ini, Operasional MRT Jakarta di hari kerja adalah pukul 05.00-24.00 WIB dengan selang waktu 5 menit di jam sibuk dan 10 menit di jam normal. Sedangkan di akhir pekan/hari libur adalah pukul 05.00-24.00 WIB dengan selang waktu 10 menit.\n\nSepanjang Januari hingga Desember 2025, PT MRT Jakarta (Perseroda) mencatat total 46.449.629 pelanggan menggunakan layanan MRT Jakarta.

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — President Prabowo Subianto emphasized his commitment to overcome child hunger and malnutrition through the Free Nutritious Meal Program (MBG). Investment in this program will also provide economic benefits of up to 35 times.\n\nThis was conveyed by Prabowo in his speech at the United States–Asean Business Summit at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington D.C., Thursday (19/2/2026).\n\nPrabowo explained that the program was inspired by practices in the United States and Europe which have long provided free meals for students. According to him, democracy must provide real benefits through education and health services.\n\nHe considers this program to be a concrete step to overcome the problem of stunting which is still experienced by around 25 percent of Indonesian children.\n\n\"I just found out that 25% of our children are stunted. Their brain cells are not optimal, as are their bone and muscle cells. They will become very physically weak when they grow up. We cannot accept this,\" he said\n\nPrabowo emphasized that program funding comes from state budget savings resulting from cutting inefficiencies and misuse of funds. He denied accusations of waste, calling the policy a reallocation of resources for the benefit of the people.\n\nAlso Read\n\nAccording to him, a number of international institutions consider the free meal program as a strategic investment. He quoted the findings of an American research institute which stated that every dollar invested could produce economic benefits of up to seven times, even up to 35 times in the long term.\n\n\"Because for every dollar spent on free meals for children, the return [return] according to their research is at least seven dollars, even in the long term it can provide returns of up to 35 times,\" he added.\n\nThe 8th President of the Republic of Indonesia also said that this program was starting to show an economic impact. Domestic consumption in January is said to be the highest in the last 10-15 years.\n\n\"We are now starting to feel the impact. Several members of Apindo [Indonesian Employers' Association] came to me last week and said that last January was the highest domestic consumption in the last 10 or 15 years,\" he said.\n\nCurrently, said Prabowo, the government has built around 23,000 program kitchens, each of which employs around 50 people in villages.\n\nThe program also increases demand for local food such as eggs, chicken and vegetables, thereby providing market certainty for farmers and creating an economic multiplier effect in rural areas.\n\nPrabowo assesses that this program helps strengthen social and political stability through creating jobs and improving community welfare. He also said that national rice production had reached a record high and was approaching self-sufficiency for most food commodities.\n\nClosing his speech, Prabowo stated that there were still many achievements that could be delivered in the first year of his government, but he chose to summarize the main points regarding priority programs that had a direct impact on the people.\n\n\"I could talk at length about the achievements of this first year, but I will keep my remarks short. As you know, if you give a microphone to a political leader, he tends not to want to stop talking,\" concluded Prabowo.",

Menurutnya, demokrasi harus menghadirkan manfaat nyata melalui layanan pendidikan dan kesehatan.\n\nDia menilai program ini menjadi langkah konkret untuk mengatasi persoalanstuntingyang masih dialami sekitar 25 persen anak Indonesia.\n\n“Saya baru tahu bahwa 25% anak-anak kami mengalamistunting[tengkes]. Sel otak mereka tidak optimal, begitu juga sel tulang dan otot mereka. Mereka akan menjadi sangat lemah secara fisik saat tumbuh dewasa. Kita tidak bisa menerima ini,” ucapnya\n\nPrabowo menegaskan pendanaan program berasal dari penghematan anggaran negara hasil pemangkasan inefisiensi dan penyalahgunaan dana. Dia membantah tudingan pemborosan, menyebut kebijakan tersebut sebagai relokasi sumber daya untuk kepentingan rakyat.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nMenurutnya, sejumlah lembaga internasional menilai program makan gratis sebagai investasi strategis. Dia mengutip temuan lembaga riset Amerika yang menyebut bahwa setiap satu dolar yang diinvestasikan dapat menghasilkan manfaat ekonomi hingga tujuh kali lipat, bahkan mencapai 35 kali lipat dalam jangka panjang.\n\n“Karena untuk setiap satu dolar yang dihabiskan untuk makan gratis bagi anak-anak, imbal hasilnya [return] menurut penelitian mereka setidaknya tujuh dolar, bahkan dalam jangka panjang bisa memberikanimbal hasilhingga 35 kali lipat,” imbuhnya.\n\nPresiden Ke-8 RI itu juga mengungkapkan program ini mulai menunjukkan dampak ekonomi. Konsumsi domestik pada Januari disebut menjadi yang tertinggi dalam 10—15 tahun terakhir.\n\n“Kami sekarang mulai merasakan dampaknya. Beberapa anggota Apindo [Asosiasi Pengusaha Indonesia] datang kepada saya minggu lalu dan mengatakan bahwa Januari kemarin adalah konsumsi domestik tertinggi dalam 10 atau 15 tahun terakhir,” tuturnya.\n\nSaat ini, kata Prabowo, pemerintah telah membangun sekitar 23.000 dapur program yang masing-masing mempekerjakan sekitar 50 orang di desa.\n\nProgram tersebut juga meningkatkan permintaan bahan pangan lokal seperti telur, ayam, dan sayuran, sehingga memberi kepastian pasar bagi petani dan menciptakan efek pengganda ekonomi di pedesaan.\n\nPrabowo menilai program ini turut memperkuat stabilitas sosial dan politik melalui penciptaan lapangan kerja serta peningkatan kesejahteraan masyarakat. Dia juga menyebut produksi beras nasional mencapai rekor tertinggi dan mendekati swasembada untuk sebagian besar komoditas pangan.\n\nMenutup pidatonya, Prabowo menyatakan masih banyak capaian yang dapat disampaikan pada tahun pertama pemerintahannya, tetapi dia memilih merangkum poin utama terkait program prioritas yang berdampak langsung bagi rakyat.\n\n“Saya bisa bicara panjang lebar mengenai pencapaian di tahun pertama ini, tapi saya akan mempersingkat sambutan saya. Seperti yang Anda tahu, jika Anda memberikan mikrofon kepada seorang pemimpin politik, dia cenderung tidak mau berhenti bicara,” pungkas Prabowo.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA – The allocation of 58.03% of village funds to the Red and White Village Cooperative (KDMP) has received various responses. Minister of Finance Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa and village heads have different views regarding the new village fund budget policy.\n\nJust for the record, Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK) no. 7/2026 concerning Village Fund Management for Fiscal Year 2026 stipulates that the government allocates more than 58% of the Village Fund allocation to support the KDMP program. In the previous regulation, aka PMK No.145/2023, there was no special allocation clause for the village cooperative program.\n\nArticle 15 paragraph (3) PMK 7/2026 specifically states that adjustments to the Village Fund allocation for KDMP reach a total nominal value of IDR 34.57 trillion.\n\nWith the total Village Fund ceiling for the 2026 Fiscal Year set at IDR 60.57 trillion, the remaining budget—excluding the Red and White Cooperative—is just IDR 25 trillion. This amount is allocated as the regular Village Fund ceiling.\n\n\"Prioritised use of Village Funds is to support sustainable development: ... e. support for the implementation of KDMP,\" as stated in Article 20 paragraph (1) letter e of the regulation.\n\nThe detailed use of these funds is directed at installment payments for the physical construction of outlets, warehousing and KDMP equipment. In line with the large allocation, the disbursement scheme is also separated exclusively.\n\nAlso Read\n\nBased on Article 22 paragraph (4), the distribution of Village Funds to support the implementation of KDMP is no longer transferred through the Regional Cash Account (RKUD), but is channeled directly from the State General Cash Account (RKUN) to the holding account for the distribution of funds.\n\nAs an additional incentive, the government also includes the status of the KDMP establishment and its business performance as crucial criteria. Villages that have KDMP business performance have the opportunity to receive additional disbursement in the form of Village Incentives taken from the fund allocation of IDR 1 trillion calculated for the current fiscal year as regulated in Article 7 paragraph (3).\n\nMinister of Finance Purbaya was not surprised to hear this figure. He even said that the 2026 Village Fund allocation for KDMP should be even higher.\n\n\"My count is bigger than that [58%],\" said Purbaya at the Senayan Parliament Complex, Jakarta, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nThe state treasurer also asked for time to ensure more certainty regarding the new Village Fund structure regulations this year. He admitted that he would check the numbers again.\n\nPreviously, President Prabowo Subianto said that the use of Village Funds was deemed ineffective.\n\nAccording to Prabowo, inefficiencies and indications of Village Fund distribution have been ongoing for the last decade. He assessed that trillions of rupiah in state money had failed to transform into real prosperity at the grassroots.\n\n\"For the past 10 years we have to admit that a lot of these funds have not reached the people. This is proven by the many village heads who have been forced to face the law because they cannot be properly accounted for in the use of these funds,\" said Prabowo at the Indonesia Economic Outlook 2026 event at Wisma Danantara, South Jakarta, Friday (13/2/2026).\n\nFor this reason, the head of state and government mandated the formation of KDMP as a new economic engine at the village level which is expected to have more measurable and accountable governance.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of village leadership organizations asked to meet Prabowo following the government's decision to allocate 58.03% of the 2026 village fund ceiling for the Red and White Village Cooperative program, aka KDMP.\n\nThis demand was conveyed directly by the leaders of six village head organizations (Kades) and the village consultative body (BPD) to the Minister of Villages and Development of Disadvantaged Regions (Mendes PDT) Yandri Susanto. They held a meeting on Monday (16/2/2026).\n\nChairman of the Central Leadership Council of the Indonesian Village Heads Association (DPP AKSI) Irawadi said the meeting was held following concerns from village leaders over President Prabowo Subianto's statement highlighting the ineffectiveness of using Village Funds, as well as responding to the issuance of a new Ministry of Finance regulation requiring 58% of Village Funds for the KDMP program.\n\nIrawadi openly admitted that the series of issues, especially Prabowo's statement, had disturbed the spiritual situation of village heads at the grassroots.\n\n\"The President's statement, yes, it is clear, it is clearly disturbing, it has made the village head's friends from the lower levels uneasy,\" he said to Bisnis, Wednesday (18/3/2026).\n\nDuring the meeting, Irawadi said that PDT Village Minister Yandri Susanto was trying to calm the village leaders. According to Yandri, he continued, Prabowo's statement was only to motivate village officials to work harder.\n\n\"But how can you be enthusiastic, if the Village Fund which is the means for developing the village has been completely cut and diverted?\" said Irawadi.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA – Pengalokasian 58,03% dana desa untuk Koperasi Desa Merah Putih (KDMP) menuai berbagai macam tanggapan. Menteri Keuangan Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa dan para kepala desa memiliki perbedaan pandangan mengenai kebijakan baru anggaran dana desa tersebut.\n\nSekadar catatan, Peraturan Menteri Keuangan (PMK) No. 7/2026 tentang Pengelolaan Dana Desa Tahun Anggaran 2026 mengatur bahwa pemerintah mengalokasikan lebih dari 58% alokasi Dana Desa untuk menyokong program KDMP. Dalam aturan sebelumnya alias PMK No.145/2023, belum ada klausul alokasi khusus untuk program koperasi desa.\n\nPasal 15 ayat (3) PMK 7/2026 secara spesifik menyatakan bahwa penyesuaian alokasi Dana Desa untuk KDMP mencapai total nominal sebesar Rp34,57 triliun.\n\nDengan total pagu Dana Desa Tahun Anggaran 2026 yang ditetapkan sebesar Rp60,57 triliun, sisa anggaran—di luar untuk Koperasi Merah Putih—tinggal sebesar Rp25 triliun. Besaran tersebut dialokasikan sebagai pagu Dana Desa reguler.\n\n\"Dana Desa diutamakan penggunaannya untuk mendukung pembangunan berkelanjutan: ... e. dukungan implementasi KDMP,\" demikian sebagaimana termaktub dalam Pasal 20 ayat (1) huruf e aturan tersebut.\n\nPenggunaan dana tersebut secara rinci diarahkan pada pembayaran angsuran dalam rangka pembangunan fisik gerai, pergudangan, dan kelengkapan KDMP. Seiring dengan besarnya alokasi tersebut, skema pencairannya pun dipisahkan secara eksklusif.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nBerdasarkan Pasal 22 ayat (4), penyaluran Dana Desa untuk dukungan implementasi KDMP tidak lagi ditransfer lewat Rekening Kas Daerah (RKUD), melainkan disalurkan langsung dari Rekening Kas Umum Negara (RKUN) ke rekening penampung penyaluran dana.\n\nSebagai insentif tambahan, pemerintah juga memasukkan status pembentukan KDMP dan kinerja usahanya sebagai kriteria krusial. Desa yang memiliki kinerja usaha KDMP berpeluang mendapatkan kucuran tambahan berupa Insentif Desa yang diambil dari alokasi dana sebesar Rp1 triliun yang dihitung pada tahun anggaran berjalan seperti yang diatur Pasal 7 ayat (3).\n\nAdapun Menkeu Purbaya tidak kaget mendengar angka tersebut. Dia malah menuturkan bahwa seharusnya alokasi Dana Desa 2026 untuk KDMP bahkan lebih tinggi lagi.\n\n\"Hitungan saya lebih besar dari itu [58%],\" ujar Purbaya di Kompleks Parlemen Senayan, Jakarta, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nBendahara negara itu pun meminta waktu untuk memastikan lebih pasti terkait aturan baru struktur Dana Desa tahun ini. Dia mengaku akan mengecek angka itu lagi.\n\nAdapun sebelumnya, penggunaan Dana Desa yang dirasa tidak efektif sudah disampaikan secara terbuka oleh Presiden Prabowo Subianto.\n\nMenurut Prabowo, inefisiensi dan indikasi penyaluran Dana Desa telah berjalan selama satu dekade terakhir. Dia menilai triliunan rupiah uang negara gagal bertransformasi menjadi kesejahteraan nyata di akar rumput.\n\n\"Selama ini 10 tahun kita harus akui banyak dana tersebut tidak sampai ke rakyat. Ini dibuktikan dengan banyak sekali kepala desa yang terpaksa berhadapan dengan hukum karena tidak dapat dipertanggungjawabkan dengan baik penggunaan dana tersebut,\" kata Prabowo dalam acara Indonesia Economic Outlook 2026 di Wisma Danantara, Jakarta Selatan, Jumat (13/2/2026).\n\nOleh sebab itu, kepala negara dan pemerintahan itu mengamanatkan pembentukan KDMP sebagai mesin ekonomi baru di tingkat desa yang diharapkan memiliki tata kelola yang lebih terukur dan akuntabel.\n\nSementara itu, sejumlah organisasi pimpinan desa meminta bertemu Prabowo usai keputusan pemerintah yang mengalokasikan 58,03% pagu dana desa 2026 untuk program Koperasi Desa Merah Putih alias KDMP.\n\nTuntutan tersebut disampaikan langsung oleh pimpinan enam organisasi kepala desa (Kades) dan badan permusyawaratan desa (BPD) kepada Menteri Desa dan Pembangunan Daerah Tertinggal (Mendes PDT) Yandri Susanto. Mereka melakukan pertemuan pada Senin (16/2/2026).\n\nKetua Dewan Pimpinan Pusat Asosiasi Kepala Desa Seluruh Indonesia (DPP AKSI) Irawadi mengungkapkan pertemuan tersebut dilakukan menyusul keresahan para pimpinan desa atas pernyataan Presiden Prabowo Subianto yang menyoroti inefektivitas penggunaan Dana Desa, sekaligus merespons terbitnya regulasi baru Kementerian Keuangan yang mewajibkan 58% Dana Desa untuk program KDMP.\n\nIrawadi secara terang-terangan mengakui bahwa rentetan isu tersebut, terutama pernyataan Prabowo, telah mengusik situasi kebatinan para kepala desa di akar rumput.\n\n\"Pernyataan Presiden, ya jelas itu, jelas mengusik lah ya, membuat gelisah para teman-teman Kades dari arus bawah\" ujarnya kepada Bisnis, Rabu (18/3/2026).\n\nDalam pertemuan, Irawadi menyampaikan Mendes PDT Yandri Susanto mencoba menenangkan para pimpinan desa. Menurut Yandri, sambungnya, pernyataan Prabowo hanya untuk memotivasi para perangkat desa agar bekerja lebih keras.\n\n\"Tapi bagaimana mau semangat, kalau Dana Desa-nya saja yang menjadi sarana untuk membangun desa sudah habis dipotong untuk dialihkan?\" ujar Irawadi.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Minister of Finance Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa revealed that the decline in the position of private External Debt (ULN) in the fourth quarter of 2025 was not related to the careful steps taken by entrepreneurs in expanding.\n\nIt is known that Bank Indonesia (BI) data shows that the position of private external debt in the fourth quarter of 2025 was recorded at US$192.78 billion. This figure is lower than the achievement in the third quarter of 2025 which was at US$194.48 billion, marking the lowest position in the last four years.\n\nPurbaya believes that the decline in private external debt cannot necessarily be translated as an indicator of sluggishness in the business world, or the easing of private expansion strategies.\n\n\"I'm sure it will fall every first, second and third quarter, then in the fourth quarter it will start to rise again in line with economic activity. In the future it will be even better,\" he said at the Senayan Parliament Complex, Jakarta, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nThis belief refers to the realization of economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2025 which reached 5.39%. This figure is higher than the previous quarters last year.\n\nFurthermore, the state treasurer views that the reduction in debt withdrawals from abroad by the private sector is in line with the government's strategy of flooding domestic banks with liquidity.\n\nAlso Read\n\nAccording to him, the abundant availability of funds in the country means that corporations have the option to switch to using financing from local banks.\n\n\"Maybe they [business actors] also see that in the country there is more funding from banks, because we are encouraging liquidity into the economic system, right? So, the translation is not one way like that [the private sector is holding back expansion],\" said Purbaya.\n\nThroughout the second half of 2025, Purbaya was observed to be aggressive in diverting state cash stored at the central bank to be distributed to commercial banks to stimulate credit distribution.\n\nIt was recorded that the initial injection was made of IDR 200 trillion to state-owned banks (Bank Mandiri, BNI, BRI, BTN) and BSI on September 12 2025. The government then again injected IDR 76 trillion on November 10 2025.\n\nEven though Purbaya had withdrawn funds amounting to IDR 75 trillion last December, the remaining state cash that was still sitting as liquidity ammunition in the domestic banking system was still recorded to be very large, reaching IDR 201 trillion.\n\nFor the record, Bank Indonesia (BI) reported that banking credit grew 9.69% on an annual basis (year on year/YoY) in 2025. Even though it was in the target range of 8-11% YoY, the realization was still lower than banking credit growth in the previous period or 2024 of 10.39%.\n\nPreviously, Bank Indonesia also reported that Indonesia's Foreign Debt reached US$431.7 billion per quarter IV/2025 or around IDR 7,196.43 trillion (JISDOR exchange rate for December 31 2025 was IDR 16,670 per US dollar).\n\nCompared to the previous period or the third quarter of 2025 of US$427.6 billion, Indonesia's foreign debt (ULN) position increased by 0.96%.\n\nExecutive Director of the Communications Department, Ramdan Denny Prakoso, explained that external debt is divided into government and private debt. In detail, government external debt was recorded at US$214.3 billion, an increase from the previous period of US$210.1 billion.\n\n\"The development of external debt was influenced by the inflow of foreign capital in international Government Securities [SBN],\" explained Denny in his statement, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nHe said the government's external debt was directed to support the financing of priority programs, which were said to be for sustainability and strengthening the national economy.\n\nBased on sector, government ULN is used for the Health Services and Social Activities Sector (22.1% of total government ULN); Government Administration, Defense, and Mandatory Social Security (19.8%); Education Services (16.2%); Construction (11.7%); to Transportation and Warehousing (8.6%).\n\n\"The position of government external debt is dominated by long-term debt with a share reaching 99.99% of the total government external debt,\" he explained.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com,JAKARTA — Menteri KeuanganPurbaya Yudhi Sadewamengungkapkan penurunan posisiUtang Luar Negeri(ULN) swasta pada kuartal IV/2025 tidak terkait langkah hati-hati pengusaha dalam berekspansi.\n\nDiketahui, Data Bank Indonesia (BI) menunjukkan posisi ULN swasta pada kuartal IV/2025 tercatat senilai US$192,78 miliar. Angka ini susut dibandingkan dengan capaian pada kuartal III/2025 yang berada di level US$194,48 miliar, sekaligus menandai posisi terendah dalam empat tahun terakhir.\n\nPurbaya menilai turunnya ULN swasta itu tidak bisa serta-merta diterjemahkan sebagai indikator kelesuan dunia usaha, maupun meredanya strategi ekspansi swasta.\n\n\"Saya yakin turunnya setiap triwulan pertama, kedua, dan ketiga, lalu pada kuartal keempat mulai naik lagi sesuai dengan aktivitas ekonomi. Ke depan akan lebih bagus lagi,\" ujarnya di Kompleks Parlemen Senayan, Jakarta, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nKeyakinan tersebut merujuk realisasi pertumbuhan ekonomi kuartal IV/2025 yang mencapai 5,39%. Angka tersebut lebih tinggi dari kuartal-kuartal sebelumnya pada tahun lalu.\n\nLebih lanjut, bendahara negara memandang penyusutan penarikan utang dari luar negeri oleh pihak swasta justru sejalan dengan strategi pemerintah yang membanjiri perbankan domestik dengan likuiditas.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nMenurutnya, ketersediaan dana yang melimpah di dalam negeri membuat korporasi memiliki opsi untuk beralih menggunakan pembiayaan dari perbankan lokal.\n\n\"Mungkin mereka [pelaku usaha] juga melihat di dalam negeri sudah lebih banyak funding dari perbankan, karena kita dorong likuiditas ke sistem perekonomian kan? Jadi, terjemahannya tidak satu arah seperti itu [swasta menahan ekspansi],\" tegas Purbaya.\n\nSepanjang paruh kedua 2025, Purbaya memang terpantau agresif mengalihkan kas negara yang tersimpan di bank sentral untuk disalurkan ke bank umum guna memacu penyaluran kredit.\n\nTercatat, injeksi perdana dilakukan sebesar Rp200 triliun ke bank pelat merah (Bank Mandiri, BNI, BRI, BTN) dan BSI pada 12 September 2025. Pemerintah kemudian kembali menyuntikkan dana Rp76 triliun pada 10 November 2025.\n\nKendati Purbaya sempat menarik kembali dana sebesar Rp75 triliun pada Desember lalu, sisa kas negara yang masih mengendap sebagai amunisi likuiditas di sistem perbankan domestik tercatat masih sangat tebal, yakni mencapai Rp201 triliun.\n\nSebagai catatan, Bank Indonesia (BI) melaporkan kredit perbankan tumbuh 9,69% secara tahunan (year on year/YoY) pada 2025. Meski berada di kisaran target 8-11% YoY, namun realisasi itu tetap lebih rendah dibandingkan pertumbuhan kredit perbankan periode sebelumnya atau 2024 sebesar 10,39%.\n\nSebelumnya, Bank Indonesia juga melaporkan Utang Luar Negeri Indonesia mencapai US$431,7 miliar per kuartal IV/2025 atau sekitar Rp7.196,43 triliun (kurs JISDOR 31 Desember 2025 sebesar Rp16.670 per dolar AS).\n\nDibandingkan periode sebelumnya atau kuartal III/2025 sebesar US$427,6 miliar, posisi utang luar negeri (ULN) Indonesia itu naik 0,96%.\n\nDirektur Eksekutif Departemen Komunikasi Ramdan Denny Prakoso menjelaskan ULN terbagi ke utang pemerintah dan swasta. Perinciannya, ULN pemerintah tercatat sebesar US$214,3 miliar atau naik dari periode sebelumnya sebesar US$210,1 miliar.\n\n\"Perkembangan ULN tersebut dipengaruhi oleh aliran masuk modal asing pada Surat Berharga Negara [SBN] internasional,\" jelas Denny dalam keterangannya, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nDia menyebut ULN pemerintah diarahkan untuk mendukung pembiayaan program-program prioritas, yang disebut untuk keberlanjutan dan penguatan perekonomian nasional.\n\nBerdasarkan sektornya, ULN pemerintah dimanfaatkan untuk Sektor Jasa Kesehatan dan Kegiatan Sosial (22,1% dari total ULN pemerintah); Administrasi Pemerintah, Pertahanan, dan Jaminan Sosial Wajib (19,8%); Jasa Pendidikan (16,2%); Konstruksi (11,7%); hingga Transportasi dan Pergudangan (8,6%).\n\n\"Posisi ULN pemerintah tersebut didominasi utang jangka panjang dengan pangsa mencapai 99,99% dari total ULN pemerintah,\" paparnya.",

The Ministry of Transportation must fight at Bappenas. In my opinion, it is a bit illogical for the Ministry of Transportation's budget to be at this year's figure,\" he stressed during the Commission V Working Meeting with the Ministry of Transportation, Wednesday (18/4/2026).\n\nFor this reason, he asked the Minister of Transportation Dudy Purwagandhi to communicate with Bappenas and provide the best possible data regarding the need for additional budget.\n\nEspecially before the Idul Fitri or Lebaran period, the Ministry of Transportation needs a lot of funds to carry out ramp checks or transportation feasibility tests.\n\nLasarus emphasized that this test is an absolute requirement, aka mandatory and non-negotiable because it involves public services and endangers many people if it is not carried out.\n\nHe views that the Ministry of Transportation is quite 'overwhelmed' in arranging Rp. 28 trillion for all of Indonesia because there are mandatory activities. The bigger the movement and the bigger the fleet, the higher the costs automatically.\n\nLasarus also asked the members of the Budget Agency (Banggar) in Commission V to return the Non-Tax State Revenue (PNBP) and Business Services Agency (BLU) that the Ministry of Transportation deposited into the state treasury, to overcome the existing backlog.\n\nThe worry, continued Lasarus, is that services will become chaotic at important moments involving many people.\n\n\"Even if you have to fly it's a plane, because there's no money for a ramp check, Mr [Minister of Transportation] grounded the plane, if there's a ship sailing, it hasn't been ramp checked, even if passengers are piled up, don't sail the ship,\" said Lasarus.\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of Transportation Dudy Purwagandhi said that his party would coordinate with Bappenas and the Ministry of Finance regarding the availability of the budget.\n\n\"We will optimize the available budget. However, we will also try as hard as possible to overcome the backlog worth IDR 20 trillion,\" he answered.\n\nIn 2026, the Ministry of Transportation will receive a budget of IDR 28.48 trillion. This amount is down from the 2025 effective ceiling of IDR 32.27 trillion, even much lower than the 2024 ceiling of IDR 45.42 trillion.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — KetuaKomisi VDPR Lasarus mendorong Kementerian Perhubungan (Kemenhub) untuk memperjuangkan tambahan alokasi dalam pagu anggaran 2026, karena memandang angka yang diterima terlalu minim, yakni senilai Rp28,48 triliun.\n\nLasarus menyampaikan, melihat postur anggaran Kemenhub, terdapat backlog atau kekurangan dana sekitar Rp20 triliun untuk tahun ini.\n\nMenurutnya, Kemenhub perlu memperjuangkan kebutuhan anggaran tersebut kepada Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional (Bappenas), karena Kemenhub memiliki tugas penting dan wajib dalam memberikan layanan publik.\n\n“Dengan backlog yang begitu besar, bagaimana menyikapi anggaran untuk fokus pelayanan publik, PSO dan subsidi angkutan, ini harus mendapat prioritas dan perhatian. Kemenhub harus berjuang di Bappenas. Menurut saya agak tidak logis anggaran Kemenhub di angka yang tahun ini,” tegasnya saat Rapat Kerja Komisi V bersama Kemenhhub, Rabu (18/4/2026).\n\nUntuk itu, dirinya meminta Menteri Perhubungan Dudy Purwagandhi untuk berkomunikasi dengan Bappenas dan memberikan data sebaik mungkin terkait kebutuhan penambahan anggaran.\n\nTerlebih menjelang periode Idulfitri atau Lebaran, Kemenhub membutuhkan banyak dana untuk melakukan ramp check atau uji kelaikan transportasi.\n\nLasarus menegaskan bahwa uji tersebut menjadi syarat mutlak alias wajib dan tidak dapat ditawar karena menyangkut layanan publik dan membahayakan banyak orang jika tidak dilakukan.\n\nDirinya memandang Kemenhub cukup ‘kewalahan’ mengatur Rp28 triliun untuk seluruh Indonesia karena ada kegiatan wajib. Semakin besar pergerakan dan semakin besar armada, otomatis biayanya semakin banyak.\n\nLasarus pun meminta kepada para anggota Badan Anggaran (Banggar) yang berada di Komisi V untuk mengembalikan Penerimaan Negara Bukan Pajak (PNBP) dan Badan Layanan Usaha (BLU) yang Kemenhub setor ke kas negara, untuk mengatasi backlog yang ada.\n\nKhawatirnya, lanjut Lasarus, pelayanan akan menjadi kacau pada momen-momen penting yang melibatkan banyak orang.\n\n“Biarpun harus terbang itu pesawat, karena enggak ada duit untuk ramp check, bapak [Menhub] grounded itu pesawat, kalau ada kapal berlayar, belum ramp check, walaupun penumpang numpuk, jangan berlayar itu kapal,” ucap Lasarus.\n\nSementara itu, Menteri Perhubungan Dudy Purwagandhi menyampaikan pihaknya akan berkoordinasi dengan Bappenas dan Kementerian Keuangan terkait ketersediaan anggaran tersebut.\n\n“Kami akan mengoptimalkan anggaran yang tersedia. Namun demikian kami juga akan berupaya sekeras mungkin untuk mengatasi backlog senilai Rp20 triliun tersebut,” jawabnya.\n\nPada 2026, Kemenhub menerima anggaran senilai Rp28,48 triliun. Jumlah tersebut turun dari pagu efektif 2025 yang senilai Rp32,27 triliun, bahkan jauh lebih rendah dari pagu 2024 yang senilai Rp45,42 triliun.",

However, this applies only to actors who are able to adapt to changes in market behavior.\n\nAli assesses that the growth of the middle class, housing needs in urban areas, and increasing interest in property investment remain the main drivers of increasing demand for property broker services from time to time.\n\nHowever, he emphasized that transaction patterns are now more rational and information-based. Because of this, the role of brokers shifts from being just an intermediary to being a property consultant who provides analysis of value, risk and investment potential.\n\n\"Brokers who survive are those who are able to add value, not just offer products. Consumers now come with data, so brokers must be better prepared in terms of knowledge, technology and service,\" he said in the LJH Realty podcast, quoted Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nHe also highlighted digitalization as a determining factor in the future of the property brokerage services industry. Online marketing platforms, virtual tours and data-based marketing are considered to accelerate natural selection in this industry.\n\nAlso Read\n\nCompanies that have a continuous training system, high service standards and modern marketing strategies are predicted to have greater opportunities for growth.\n\nHowever, Ali emphasized that the industry's main challenge is not market demand, but the quality of human resources. He said that professionalism, integrity and consistent self-development are the main foundations for brokers who want to survive in the long term.\n\n\"With increasing consumer expectations and information transparency, professionalism is no longer an option, but a basic requirement to survive in the property marketing services business in Indonesia,\" he added.\n\nDirector of LJH Realty, Oka Mahendra, believes that changes in consumer behavior and digitalization of marketing require property brokers to continue to increase their capacity, with an excellent service orientation.\n\n\"The growth of digital property platforms has encouraged an increase in the number of brokers in Indonesia. Along with increasing consumer education, service differentiation has now become the main factor for success in competition in the property broker services industry,\" he said.\n\nQuoting Indonesian Real Estate (REI) data, it shows that the growth in property transactions in big cities is accompanied by an increase in the number of brokers and property brokerage offices.\n\nMeanwhile, marketing platforms such as Rumah123 and other digital portals reveal changes in the way brokers search for clients, market units and build reputations.\n\n\"This condition makes the professionalism standards of brokers even higher, starting from communication skills, understanding the legality of transactions, to mastery of digital marketing,\" said Oka.\n\nAccording to Oka Mahendra, a professional broker should have a number of main characteristics and competencies. First, consistent self-development. Professionalism is not formed in a short time. Brokers must continue to learn, practice and update their marketing and communications skills.\n\nSecond, implementing high service standards. Third, strategic marketing competency, where property brokers are required to be able to understand consumer psychology, negotiation techniques and data-based marketing strategies.\n\nFourth, certification and professional track record. Professional property brokers undergo continuous training, have competency certification, and demonstrate consistent performance.\n\nFifth, mastery of digital technology, including the ability to use social media, educational videos and digital platforms. It is an important part of modern professionalism.\n\nOka added, in facing tight competition in the property marketing services industry, br Oker must place human resource development as the main strategy for business sustainability.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — The Indonesian Tin Exporters Association (AETI) reminded the government to ensure the readiness of the downstream industry before realizing plans to stop tin exports, especially in the form of ingots. AETI General Chair Harwendro Adityo Dewanto emphasized that there needs to be a clear distinction between tin ore and tin ingots in export policies. According to him, the export of tin ore has indeed been banned, while the export of ingots is still ongoing. He explained that domestic absorption of national tin ingot production is currently still very limited. Based on AETI data, domestic absorption is only around 5%–7% of total production, so around 95% is still dependent on the export market. \"Last year our production was around 52,000 tons. What was absorbed domestically was below 10%, around 5% to 7%. This means that almost 95% was still exported,\" said Harwendro to Bisnis, Wednesday (18/2/2026). country. However, the target for 100% of tin ingot production to be absorbed in the domestic market is not realistic in the near future. This is because the number of downstream tin industry players in Indonesia is still very limited. \"If we have data, there are not even 10 tin downstream companies in Indonesia. So how can all production be absorbed if there are not many industries,\" he said. Therefore, his party believes that steps to stop tin ingot exports should be taken after there is certainty that the domestic market is able to absorb production significantly. Apart from the limited number of industries, business actors also face regulatory obstacles. technical. Harwendro gave an example of product specification regulations which he considered were still rigid, making it difficult for downstream producers to meet market needs. \"We have products, but they can't be sold because buyers ask for certain specifications—certain grades and contents—while the regulations are still not flexible to follow market conditions,\" he explained. With these conditions, Harwendro believes that the plan to stop exporting tin ingots is not ideal to implement this year.\n\nAlso Read\n\nHe also reminded the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) to first strengthen the downstream ecosystem, increase the number of industrial players, and improve regulations so that they are more adaptive to market needs. \"If you look at the industry's absorption in the country which is still low, I think this year it is still not possible. We must first ensure that the downstream industry is ready and able to absorb it,\" said Harwendro. He emphasized that without adequate downstream industry readiness, the export stop policy risks putting pressure on domestic producers and disrupting business sustainability, instead of accelerating downstreaming.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com,JAKARTA — Asosiasi EksportirTimahIndonesia (AETI) mengingatkan pemerintah agar memastikan kesiapan industri hilir sebelum merealisasikan rencana penghentianeksportimah, khususnya dalam bentuk ingot.Ketua Umum AETI Harwendro Adityo Dewanto menegaskan, perlu ada pembedaan yang jelas antara bijih timah dan ingot timah dalam kebijakan ekspor. Menurutnya, ekspor bijih timah memang sudah dilarang, sementara ekspor ingot hingga kini masih berjalan.Dia menjelaskan, serapan domestik terhadap produksi ingot timah nasional saat ini masih sangat terbatas. Berdasarkan data AETI, penyerapan dalam negeri baru berkisar 5%–7% dari total produksi, sehingga sekitar 95% masih bergantung pada pasar ekspor.“Tahun lalu produksi kita sekitar 52.000 ton. Yang diserap di dalam negeri itu di bawah 10%, sekitar 5% sampai 7%. Artinya hampir 95% masih ekspor,” kata Harwendro kepada Bisnis, Rabu (18/2/2026).Harwendro mengaku mendukung cita-cita pemerintah untuk mendorong hilirisasi dan meningkatkan nilai tambah di dalam negeri. Namun, target agar 100% produksi ingot timah terserap di pasar domestik belum realistis dalam waktu dekat.Pasalnya, jumlah pelaku industri hilir timah di Indonesia masih sangat terbatas.“Kalau kita data, perusahaan hilirisasi timah di Indonesia itu tidak sampai 10. Jadi bagaimana mungkin seluruh produksi bisa terserap kalau industrinya saja belum banyak,” ujarnya.Oleh karena itu, pihaknya menilai langkah penghentian ekspor ingot timah seharusnya dilakukan setelah ada kepastian pasar dalam negeri mampu menyerap produksi secara signifikan.Selain keterbatasan jumlah industri, pelaku usaha juga menghadapi kendala regulasi teknis. Harwendro mencontohkan aturan spesifikasi produk yang dinilai masih kaku, sehingga menyulitkan produsen hilir memenuhi kebutuhan pasar.“Kita punya produk, tapi tidak bisa dijual karena pembeli minta spesifikasi tertentu—kadar dan kandungan tertentu—sementara aturan masih belum fleksibel mengikuti kondisi pasar,” jelasnya.Dengan kondisi tersebut, Harwendro menilai rencana penghentian ekspor ingot timah belum ideal untuk diterapkan tahun ini.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nDia pun mengingatkan Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) untuk lebih dulu memperkuat ekosistem hilir, memperbanyak pelaku industri, serta membenahi regulasi agar lebih adaptif terhadap kebutuhan pasar.“Kalau melihat serapan industri di dalam negeri yang masih rendah, saya menilai tahun ini masih belum bisa. Harus dipastikan dulu industri hilirnya siap dan mampu menyerap,” kata Harwendro.Dia menekankan, tanpa kesiapan industri hilir yang memadai, kebijakan setop ekspor berisiko menekan produsen dalam negeri dan mengganggu keberlanjutan usaha, alih-alih mempercepat hilirisasi.",

The lowest sales price was recorded at IDR 25,000 per kilogram.\n\nSeparately, the Ministry of Trade (Kemendag) denied that the supply of purebred chicken meat and eggs was running low on the market due to the Free Nutritious Meal (MBG) program.\n\nMinister of Trade (Mendag) Budi Santoso said that MBG actually creates demand certainty which makes poultry production move more stably and measurably.\n\n\"No, it's like this, right? I have actually discussed this with friends. In the past, prices went up and down because demand went up and down. Demand went up and down, prices went up and down,\" said Budi when met at the Ministry of Trade Office, Jakarta, Wednesday (18/2/2026).",

Convection business players have recorded a significant increase in orders in the last 2 months, in line with increasing public needs.\n\nChairman of the Working Convection Entrepreneurs Association (IPKB) Nandi Herdiaman said that the trend of increasing orders this year was much better than the same period last year. This increase is considered to be a positive signal for small and medium industrial players who had faced pressure throughout the previous year.\n\n\"There has been a decent increase in orders this year, from the last 2 months there has been an increase of around 60% from last year,\" said Nandi to Bisnis, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nNot only from the production side, market activity is also starting to be seen in a number of textile and clothing trading centers. People's shopping activities in traditional markets and wholesale centers show an increase, especially towards the peak of the Ramadan shopping season.\n\nSeveral locations such as Tanah Abang in Jakarta and Andir Market in Bandung are said to have experienced a surge in the number of visitors. This increase in buyer traffic provides additional encouragement for retail traders and convection manufacturers.\n\n\"On the offline market, it has started to look more vibrant, for example in Tanah Abang and Andir Market in Bandung, there has been an increase of around 30% in visitors,\" he said.\n\nAlso Read\n\nHowever, business actors still face a number of challenges, especially in the realm of online marketing.

The reason is, imported goods can be easily marketed at low prices.\n\nNandi also believes that the massive number of imported products sold at low prices in e-commerce makes it difficult for SMEs to compete.\n\n\"Online platforms as sales places should have clear regulations to ensure prices are fair and not skewed,\" said Nandi in a written statement, Wednesday (11/2/2026).\n\nCurrently, regulations related to the trade system for importing textiles and textile products (TPT) have been regulated by the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Industry.\n\nHowever, Nandi believes that there are still many imported products being sold in e-commerce at unreasonable prices which makes SMEs unable to compete and ultimately suffer losses.\n\nNot only that, according to him, traditional markets also need attention because many offline markets are closed and empty of visitors due to the shift of consumers to online.\n\n\"We hope that the government will supervise e-commerce and ensure that online platforms have clear regulations to protect SMEs. We also hope that the government can provide support to SMEs to increase their capabilities and competitiveness,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, online platforms have become 85% of market sales, so it is very important for the government to supervise and ensure that all parties can compete fairly.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Economists reveal the advantages and disadvantages of the government's efforts to collaborate with New Energy Metals Holdings Ltd (NEM) to develop the rare earth metals (LTJ) ecosystem. Meanwhile, the collaboration was carried out through PT Perusahaan Mineral Nasional (Persero) or Perminas together with Danantara. This collaboration includes evaluating the potential of niobium and LTJ Maboumine resources in the Republic of Gabon, as well as downstream initiatives in Indonesia. Through this partnership, Indonesia is projected to act as a platform for downstream processing, manufacturing and industrial integration. This collaboration covers the entire value chain, from separation, refining, metal production, to manufacturing high-performance permanent magnets. Director of the Center of Economic and Law Studies (Celios) Bhima Yudhistira assesses that the agreement allows Perminas under Danantara to get access to LTJ from Gabon for a mix of defense industry and electronic products. According to him, there are challenges from a technical and capital perspective related to managing LTJ in Indonesia. Therefore, managing LTJ in Gabon is considered cheaper. Moreover, Indonesia is not a country that has abundant LTJ reserves. Apart from that, most of the LTJ in Indonesia is still in the exploration stage. However, Bhima is of the opinion that Perminas' collaboration with NEM has the potential to make Indonesia an importer of LTJ only. \"But the BUMN's decision in Gabon means that Indonesia is actually only an importer of rare earth [LTJ] without having similar mineral downstreaming in the country,\" said Bhima to Bisnis, Wednesday (18/2/2026). According to Bhima, this collaboration could be profitable if there is a transfer of technology to the BUMN that manages downstreaming. Therefore, he believes that the collaboration with NEM should ideally be carried out by MIND ID instead of Perminas. This is because MIND ID has more long experience in the mineral sector. Bhima also emphasized that Danantara should focus more on improving the governance of existing minerals such as nickel and bauxite. \"Danantara should just focus on improving the governance of existing minerals such as nickel and bauxite with issues of price, production capacity, and reducing the environmental impact of smelter energy sources,\" said Bhima. Meanwhile, Executive Director of the Center for Energy and Mining Law Studies (Pushep) Bisman Bhaktiar believes that cooperation between Perminas and NEM can provide initial access to LTJ resources. strategic for the battery, electric vehicle and high technology industries. \"We, Indonesia, have the potential to secure supplies of raw materials while building downstream capacity domestically so that we not only become a market, but also a player in the global supply chain for critical minerals,\" said Bisman. He said that Indonesia's LTJ reserves are still limited and generally in the form of associated minerals, while Gabon is known to have significant and integrated LTJ potential. is increasing due to the need for the energy transition and for electric vehicles as well as the new renewable energy (EBT) development industry. \"If managed with technology transfer and the construction of domestic processing facilities, the prospects are quite promising both in terms of industrial added value and Indonesia's bargaining position in the geopolitics of critical minerals,\" said Bisman.\n\nAlso Read",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com,JAKARTA — Ekonom mengungkapkan keuntungan dan kekurangan dari upaya pemerintah menjalin kolaborasi dengan New Energy Metals Holdings Ltd (NEM) untuk mengembangkan ekosistemlogam tanah jarang(LTJ).Adapun, kolaborasi itu dilakukan lewat PT Perusahaan Mineral Nasional (Persero) atauPerminasbersamaDanantara. Kerja sama itu mencakup evaluasi potensi sumber daya niobium dan LTJ Maboumine di RepublikGabon, sekaligus inisiatif hilirisasi di Indonesia.Melalui kemitraan ini, Indonesia diproyeksikan berperan sebagai platform pemrosesan hilir, manufaktur, dan integrasi industri. Kolaborasi tersebut mencakup seluruh rantai nilai, mulai dari pemisahan, pemurnian, produksi logam, hingga manufaktur magnet permanen berkinerja tinggi.Direktur Center of Economic and Law Studies (Celios) Bhima Yudhistira menilai, perjanjian itu membuat Perminas di bawah Danantara mendapat akses LTJ dari Gabon untuk campuran industri pertahanan dan produk elektronik.Menurutnya, terdapat tantangan dari segi teknis dan permodalan terkait pengelolaan LTJ di Indonesia. Oleh karena itu, mengelola LTJ di Gabon dinilai lebih murah.Apalagi, Indonesia bukan negara yang punya cadangan LTJ melimpah. Selain itu, sebagian besar LTJ di Indonesia masih dalam tahap eksplorasi.Kendati demikian, Bhima berpendapat kerja sama Perminas dengan NEM berpotensi membuat Indonesia sebagai importir LTJ saja.\"Tapi keputusan BUMN di Gabon membuat Indonesia sebenarnya hanya jadi importirrare earth[LTJ] tanpa punya hilirisasi mineral sejenis di dalam negeri,\" tutur Bhima kepadaBisnis, Rabu (18/2/2026).Menurut Bhima, kerja sama tadi bisa menguntungkan kalau terjadi transfer teknologi ke BUMN yang mengurus hilirisasi. Oleh karena itu, dia menilai kerja sama dengan NEM idealnya dilakukan oleh MIND ID alih-alih Perminas.Pasalnya, MIND ID lebih memiliki pengalaman panjang di sektor mineral. Bhima pun menekankan, seharusnya Danantara lebih fokus memperbaiki tata kelola mineral yang sudah ada seperti nikel dan bauksit.\"Danantara fokus saja memperbaiki tata kelola mineral yang sudah ada seperti nikel dan bauksit dengan persoalan harga, kapasitas produksi, hingga mengurangi dampak lingkungan dari sumber energi smelter,\" ucap Bhima.Sementara itu, Direktur Eksekutif Pusat Studi Hukum Energi dan Pertambangan (Pushep) Bisman Bhaktiar berpendapat, kerja sama antara Perminas dan NEM bisa memberi akses awal terhadap sumber daya LTJ yang strategis untuk industri baterai, kendaraan listrik, dan teknologi tinggi.\"Kita Indonesia berpotensi mengamankan pasokan bahan baku sekaligus membangun kapasitas hilirisasi di dalam negeri sehingga tidak hanya menjadi pasar, tetapi juga pemain dalam rantai pasok global mineral kritis,\" ucap Bisman.Dia menuturkan, cadangan LTJ Indonesia masih terbatas dan umumnya berupa mineral ikutan, sementara Gabon dikenal memiliki potensi LTJ yang signifikan dan terintegrasi.Menurut Bisman, kolaborasi di luar negeri ini bisa jadi merupakan strategi untuk pengamanan pasokan agar Indonesia tidak bergantung pada satu sumber atau negara tertentu.Terlebih, permintaan LTJ global terus meningkat karena kebutuhan transisi energi dan untuk kendaraan listrik serta industri pengembangan energi baru terbarukan (EBT).\"Jika dikelola dengan transfer teknologi dan pembangunan fasilitas pemrosesan di dalam negeri, prospeknya cukup menjanjikan baik dari sisi nilai tambah industri maupun posisi tawar Indonesia dalam geopolitik mineral kritis,\" tutur Bisman.\n\nBaca Juga",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Deputy Chairman of Commission IXDPR RI Charles Honoris emphasized the need for cross-ministerial steps to resolve the issue of the rights of former PT Merpati Nusantara Airlines workers which has not yet been resolved.\n\nHe believes that selling company assets alone is not enough to cover obligations to workers. According to him, the state must be actively present considering that Merpati Airlines is a state-owned company.\n\n\"This is not just a matter of numbers. There are 1,225 people who are pinning their hopes on resolving this problem. The state must not let go,\" said Charles at the Public Hearing Meeting (RDPU), Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nTherefore, Charles encouraged holding a joint meeting with the relevant commissions by presenting ministries with authority, including the financial sector and management of BUMN. According to him, this effort is crucial so that concrete solutions can be formulated immediately.\n\nFurthermore, Charles also emphasized that the constitution mandates the state to protect workers' rights, rather than leaving them in limbo without certainty.\n\nCharles ensured that Commission IX of the DPR would bring this issue to internal discussion and follow up in the next session by summoning the relevant parties.\n\nAlso Read\n\n\"We will stand with all ladies and gentlemen to fight for the rights they should receive. This is the state's responsibility,\" he concluded.\n\nOn this occasion, the Justice Solidarity of Ex-Employees of PT Merpati Nusantara Airlines expressed their complaint regarding severance pay arrears for 12 years or since 2014.\n\nThis is because as many as 1,225 employees who stopped working since 2014 and have been waiting for a bankruptcy declaration for 10 years, still have to wait for a solution to resolve severance pay.\n\n\"We hope that the DPR can be the spearhead in fighting for the rights of PT Merpati Nusantara employees by carrying out the process of resolving the severance pay issue,\" he said.\n\nApart from that, the representative of former state-owned airline employees, Agus Slamet Budiman, explained that the company had paid IDR 96 billion to 1,225 former employees from a PT Perusahaan Pengelola Aset (PPA) loan from a total severance pay obligation of IDR 413 billion.\n\nThus, there are still pending obligations worth IDR 317 billion. Agus said that when PT Merpati Nusantara was declared bankrupt as of June 2 2022, the court had appointed a curator to sell the company's assets.\n\nA number of assets that were sold from 2023 to 2026 were partly used to pay severance pay installments worth IDR 65.9 billion. Specifically in 2026, new installment payments amounting to IDR 402 million will be distributed to 1,225 employees.\n\nAs a result, the total severance pay arrears are still worth IDR 251.5 billion. However, around 90% of Merpati Nusantara's assets have been sold out.\n\n\"We hope that government policy and Commission IX can solve this problem considering that Merpati has also contributed greatly to this country as a bridge to the archipelago through opening routes to various regions and at the same time being a driver of economic growth,\" he concluded.",

Menurutnya, negara harus hadir secara aktif mengingatMerpati Airlinesmerupakan badan usaha milik negara.\n\n“Ini bukan sekadar soal angka. Ada 1.225 orang yang menggantungkan harapan pada penyelesaian masalah ini. Negara tidak boleh lepas tangan,” kata Charles dalam Rapat Dengar Pendapat Umum (RDPU), Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nMaka dari itu, Charles mendorong digelarnya rapat gabungan dengan komisi terkait dengan menghadirkan kementerian yang memiliki kewenangan, termasuk sektor keuangan dan pengelolaan BUMN. Upaya ini, menurutnya, bernilai krusial agar solusi konkret bisa segera dirumuskan.\n\nLebih lanjut, Charles juga menekankan konstitusi mengamanatkan negara untuk melindungi hak-hak pekerja, bukan justru membiarkan mereka terkatung-katung tanpa kepastian.\n\nCharles memastikan Komisi IX DPR akan membawa persoalan ini ke pembahasan internal dan menindaklanjutinya pada masa sidang berikutnya dengan memanggil pihak-pihak terkait.\n\nBaca Juga\n\n“Kami akan berdiri bersama bapak-ibu semua memperjuangkan hak yang seharusnya diterima. Ini tanggung jawab negara,” pungkasnya.\n\nPada kesempatan tersebut, Solidaritas Keadilan Eks Pegawai PT Merpati Nusantara Airlines menyampaikan keluhannya terkait tunggakan pesangon selama 12 tahun atau sejak 2014.\n\nPasalnya sebanyak 1.225 karyawan yang berhenti bekerja sejak 2014 dan telah menunggu pernyataan pailit selama 10 tahun, masih harus menunggu solusi penyelesaian pesangon.\n\n“Kami berharap DPR dapat menjadi ujung tombak dalam memperjuangkan hak-hak karyawan PT Merpati Nusantara dengan melakukan proses penyelesaian masalah pesangon,” tuturnya.\n\nSelain itu, perwakilan mantan pegawai maskapai pelat merah Agus Slamet Budiman menjelaskan, perusahaan telah membayar Rp96 miliar kepada 1.225 eks pegawai yang berasal dari pinjaman PT Perusahaan Pengelola Aset (PPA) dari total kewajiban pesangon senilai Rp413 miliar.\n\nDengan demikian, masih terdapat kewajiban yang tertunda senilai Rp317 miliar. Agus menuturkan, saat PT Merpati Nusantara dinyatakan pailit per 2 Juni 2022, pengadilan telah menunjuk kurator untuk menjual aset perusahaan.\n\nSejumlah aset yang telah terjual sejak 2023 hingga 2026 pun sebagian digunakan untuk membayar cicilan pesangon senilai Rp65,9 miliar. Khusus pada 2026, pembayaran cicilan baru sejumlah Rp402 juta yang dibagikan kepada 1.225 pegawai.\n\nAlhasil, total tunggakan pesangon masih senilai Rp251,5 miliar. Namun, sekitar 90% aset Merpati Nusantara telah habis terjual.\n\n“Mohon kiranya kebijakan pemerintah dan Komisi IX dapat menyelesaikan masalahnya ini mengingat Merpati juga pernah hadir berkontribusi besar pada negeri ini sebagai jembatan Nusantara melalui pembukaan rute-rute berbagai daerah dan sekaligus menjadi pendorong penggerak pertumbuhan ekonomi,” tutupnya.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Manufacturing productivity is in the spotlight of the World Bank because it is considered to still provide low added value, especially to the workforce.\n\nProfessor at the Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Indonesia, Telisa Aulia Falianty, said that overall national manufacturing growth was increasing.\n\n\"Judging from the share, it has increased at 19%, growth is above 5%, from this BPS data, productivity has actually increased. However, the World Bank highlights human resource productivity, meaning production per capita,\" said Telisa to Business, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nIf we look at per capita production, Telisa said, national industry is indeed lagging behind other countries, such as Thailand, Malaysia and India.\n\nTelisa assesses that this condition is triggered by the flow of investment into Indonesia, the majority of which are capital-intensive industries. Meanwhile, technology transfer from this industry is also considered to be still rare.\n\nTherefore, he revealed the importance of concrete and measurable steps to increase national productivity. According to him, productivity is the key so that Indonesia is able to strengthen industrial competitiveness amidst increasingly tight global competition.\n\nAlso Read\n\nBased on data from the Asian Productivity Organization (APO), the productivity of Indonesian workers in recent years has indeed shown improvement.\n\nIn 2022, Indonesia's productivity will be recorded at around US$28.6 per worker, an increase compared to 2018 which was around US$23.9. However, this figure is still below the Asean average which has reached around US$30.2.\n\nIn terms of growth, Indonesia's productivity index (2010=1.0) has indeed increased consistently until 2022. However, the rate of increase is still lagging behind a number of countries such as China, Vietnam and Bangladesh which recorded higher acceleration in the same period.\n\n\"This means that we need to encourage transformation so that labor-intensive sectors can move up in class and produce greater added value,\" he explained.\n\nAs a solution, Telisa encourages a 4P approach, namely people, process, product and policy. In the people aspect, improving the quality of human resources is a priority, including competency-based training and preparing productivity specialists. On the process and product side, direct evaluation and intervention is needed in companies, especially medium scale.\n\nMeanwhile, from a policy or regulatory perspective, strengthening the productivity ecosystem is considered important, starting from establishing a national productivity institution, giving productivity awards, to strengthening international networks through APO. He also emphasized the importance of utilizing data through productivity dashboards and labor market analysis as a basis for policy.\n\nWith directed and collaborative steps, Telisa is optimistic that Indonesia's productivity can grow faster and catch up with benchmark countries in the Asian region.\n\nMeanwhile, Institute For Development of Economics and Finance (Indef) researcher Ariyo DP Irhamna said the government also needs to be more selective in providing incentives to investors. In this case, it is important to restructure the tax holiday so that it requires local content, technology transfer and integration of domestic suppliers, not just the establishment of an assembly plant.\n\n\"Then, strengthening human resources and infrastructure. Vocational reforms that are in line with the needs of technology-intensive industries and improving logistics to reduce production costs,\" he said.\n\nNo less important is integration into the global value chain by encouraging domestic companies to enter multinational supply networks through quality standards, certification and export facilitation.\n\nFurthermore, the commercialization of domestic research and innovation is considered to be the biggest gap that has so far been ignored. The reason is, Indef sees that many BRIN and university research results stop at the prototype or even patent stage.\n\nHe also mentioned concrete steps such as strengthening office licensing technology (TLO) in research institutions and universities with a real commercial mandate, create a government-industry matching grant scheme to finance the pilot stage, reform intellectual property rights (IPR) regulations so that the patent process is faster and cheaper, and provide tax incentives for companies that purchase technology licenses from domestic research institutions.\n\n\"Without a bridge between laboratories and markets, research investment will never translate into industrial productivity,\" he concluded.",

Namun, World Bank menyoroti produktivitas SDM, artinya produksi per kapita,\" kata Telisa kepadaBisnis, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nJika dilihat dari produksi per kapita, Telisa menyebut, industri nasional memang tertinggal dibandingkan negara lain, seperti Thailand, Malaysia, maupun India.\n\nTelisa menilai kondisi ini dipicu arus investasi yang masuk ke Indonesia mayoritas industri padat modal. Sementara itu, transfer teknologi dari industri tersebut juga dinilai masih langka.\n\nOleh karena itu, dia mengungkap pentingnya langkah konkret dan terukur untuk meningkatkan produktivitas nasional. Menurutnya, produktivitas menjadi kunci agar Indonesia mampu memperkuat daya saing industri di tengah persaingan global yang semakin ketat.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nBerdasarkan data Asian Productivity Organization (APO), produktivitas tenaga kerja Indonesia dalam beberapa tahun terakhir memang menunjukkan perbaikan.\n\nPada 2022, produktivitas Indonesia tercatat sekitar US$28,6 per tenaga kerja, meningkat dibandingkan 2018 yang berada di kisaran US$23,9. Namun, angka tersebut masih di bawah rata-rata Asean yang telah mencapai sekitar US$30,2.\n\nDari sisi pertumbuhan, indeks produktivitas Indonesia (2010=1,0) memang naik secara konsisten hingga 2022. Meski begitu, laju kenaikannya masih tertinggal dibandingkan sejumlah negara seperti China, Vietnam, dan Bangladesh yang mencatat percepatan lebih tinggi dalam periode yang sama.\n\n“Artinya, kita perlu mendorong transformasi agar sektor padat karya bisa naik kelas dan menghasilkan nilai tambah yang lebih besar,\" terangnya.\n\nSebagai solusi, Telisa mendorong pendekatan 4P, yaitupeople, process, product,danpolicy. Pada aspekpeople, peningkatan kualitas sumber daya manusia menjadi prioritas, termasuk pelatihan berbasis kompetensi dan penyiapan spesialis produktivitas. Di sisiprocessdanproduct, diperlukan evaluasi dan intervensi langsung di perusahaan, terutama skala menengah.\n\nSementara dari sisipolicyatau regulasi, penguatan ekosistem produktivitas dinilai penting, mulai dari pembentukan lembaga produktivitas nasional, pemberian penghargaan produktivitas, hingga penguatan jejaring internasional melalui APO. Ia juga menekankan pentingnya pemanfaatan data melalui dashboard produktivitas dan analisis pasar tenaga kerja sebagai dasar kebijakan.\n\nDengan langkah yang terarah dan kolaboratif, Telisa optimistis produktivitas Indonesia dapat tumbuh lebih cepat dan mengejar ketertinggalan dari negara-negarabenchmarkdi kawasan Asia.\n\nSementara itu, peneliti Institute For Development of Economics and Finance (Indef) Ariyo DP Irhamna mengatakan, pemerintah juga perlu lebih selektif dalam memberikan insentif kepada investor.

Pasalnya, Indef melihat ada banyak hasil riset BRIN dan universitas berhenti di tahap prototipe atau bahkan paten saja.\n\nDia juga menyebutkan langkah konkret seperti penguatantechnology licensing office(TLO) di lembaga riset dan perguruan tinggi dengan mandat komersial yang nyata, buat skemamatching grantpemerintah-industri untuk membiayai tahap pilot, reformasi regulasi hak kekayaan intelektual (HKI) agar proses paten lebih cepat dan murah, dan berikan insentif pajak bagi perusahaan yang membeli lisensi teknologi dari lembaga riset domestik.\n\n\"Tanpa jembatan antara laboratorium dan pasar, investasi riset tidak akan pernah menjelma menjadi produktivitas industri,\" pungkasnya.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — The Association of Indonesian Mining Experts (Perhapi) considers the government's plan to ban tin exports to be a strategic step to encourage the growth of the domestic manufacturing industry. Meanwhile, the government's move to stop tin exports is to encourage downstreaming within the country. That way, added value can be created. Chairman of the Perhapi Advisory Board, Rizal Kasli, is of the opinion that the government should focus on developing the domestic manufacturing ecosystem, especially in the downstream industry of tin commodities. According to him, what PT Timah Tbk and other tin companies produce is currently only at the intermediate product stage, of which more than 90% is exported abroad. The reason is that domestic absorption is not yet large, so the choice is to export. \"If this policy [stop tin exports] is realized, it will provide high added value in the utilization of Indonesia's mineral resources,\" said Rizal to Bisnis, Wednesday (18/2/2026). Moreover, intermediate products still require further stages to produce finished products. He gave an example, for industrial needs such as cans and tin soldering, the need for tin plate (tinplate) by PT Latinusa for example is still very low, namely around 6% which uses domestically produced tin commodities. Rizal also believes that stopping tin exports will open up many job opportunities. This is in line with the development of the domestic manufacturing industry. \"The President [Prabowo Subianto] with his political promises in the campaign emphasized that he would create as many jobs as possible. This can be achieved by building as many domestic industries as possible, especially derivative industries from mineral and coal commodities and other natural resources,\" he explained. Nevertheless, Rizal reminded that steps to stop tin exports need to be studied comprehensively first with industry associations, professions and related ministries/institutions. This is to determine the positive and negative impacts as well as the amount of domestic absorption. According to him, the export ban can be implemented in stages if domestic industry absorption cannot accommodate 100% of the product. One step that the government can take is to implement a domestic market obligation (DMO) scheme as applied to coal commodities. \"The increase in the DMO percentage is carried out in stages according to developments in the domestic industry. The government's focus is to create derivative industries to produce finished goods,\" added Rizal. He also warned that if this policy must be implemented 100% and a domestic market has not been created, it will disrupt the cash flow of mining companies. Because, there are products that cannot be sold and will become dead stock.\n\nAlso Read",

Dengan begitu, nilai tambah dapat tercipta.Ketua Dewan Penasehat Perhapi Rizal Kasli berpendapat, sudah seharusnya pemerintah fokus dalam pengembangan ekosistem manufaktur dalam negeri terutama di industri hilir dari komoditas timah.Menurutnya, apa yang dihasilkan oleh PT Timah Tbk dan perusahaan timah lainnya saat ini baru pada tahap produk antara (intermediate product) yang lebih dari 90% diekspor ke luar negeri. Pasalnya, serapan dalam negeri belum besar sehingga pilihannya adalah melakukan ekspor.\"Kebijakan ini [setop ekspor timah] apabila terealisasi akan memberikan nilai tambah yang tinggi dalam pemanfaatan sumber daya mineral Indonesia,\" ucap Rizal kepadaBisnis, Rabu (18/2/2026).Dia mengatakan, sangat disayangkan kalau komoditas ini tidak bisa dimanfaatkan secara maksimal di dalam negeri untuk kebangkitan industri manufaktur. Apalagi, produk antara masih memerlukan tahapan lanjutan untuk menghasilkan produk jadi.Dia mencontohkan, untuk kebutuhan industri seperti kaleng hingga timah solder, kebutuhan pelat timah (tinplate)oleh PT Latinusa misalnya masih sangat rendah, yaitu sekitar 6% yang menggunakan komoditas timah produksi dalam negeri.Rizal juga menilai penghentian ekspor timah akan membuka banyak lapangan kerja. Hal ini seiring dengan pengembangan industri manufaktur dalam negeri.\"Presiden [Prabowo Subianto] dengan janji politiknya dalam kampanye menekankan akan menciptakan lapangan kerja sebanyak-banyaknya. Ini bisa dicapai dengan membangun industri di dalam negeri sebanyak-banyaknya terutama industri turunan dari komoditas mineral dan batu bara serta sumber daya alam lainnya,\" jelasnya.Kendati demikian, Rizal mengingatkan bahwa langkah penghentian ekspor timah perlu dikaji terlebih dahulu secara komprehensif dengan asosiasi industri, profesi dan kementerian/lembaga terkait. Ini guna mengetahui dampak positif dan negatif serta besarnya serapan dalam negeri.Menurutnya, pelarangan ekspor tersebut bisa dilakukan secara bertahap apabila serapan industri dalam negeri belum dapat menampung 100% dari produk. Salah satu langkah yang bisa dilakukan pemerintah adalah dengan penerapan skemadomestic market obligation(DMO) seperti yang diberlakukan di komoditas batu bara.\"Penambahan persentase DMO dilakukan bertahap sesuai perkembangan industri dalam negeri. Fokus pemerintah adalah menciptakan industri turunan sehingga menghasilkan barang jadi,\" imbuh Rizal.Dia pun mewanti-wanti apabila kebijakan ini serta merta harus diterapkan 100% dan pasar di dalam negeri belum tercipta, maka akan mengganggucash flowperusahaan tambang. Sebab, terdapat produk yang tidak bisa dijual dan akan menjadidead stock.\n\nBaca Juga",

Namun, masih ada tantangan yang dihadapi, terutama terkait ketersediaan lahan yang sesuai dengan kebutuhan pembangunan koperasi desa.\n\n“Kami memahami adanya keterbatasan lahan di beberapa desa dan kelurahan. Oleh karena itu, kami akan segera menyesuaikan spesifikasi pembangunan fisik koperasi agar bisa lebih fleksibel dan sesuai dengan kondisi lokal,” kata Ferry dalam keterangan tertulis, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nUntuk mengatasi keterbatasan lahan tersebut, Kemenkop berencana menerapkan desain pembangunan yang lebih fleksibel bagi koperasi yang dibangun di desa dengan luas lahan terbatas. Nantinya, kebijakan ini akan diteruskan kepada PT Agrinas Pangan Nusantara sebagai pelaksana pembangunan fisik gedung KopDes Merah Putih.\n\nFerry menjelaskan langkah ini dilakukan agar pembangunan fisik tetap dapat memenuhi standar yang ditetapkan, meskipun dengan adanya keterbatasan fisik yang berbeda di tiap wilayah.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nBerdasarkan data yang dihimpun Command Center Kemenkop, sebanyak 48.734 lahan sudah dilakukan pemetaan dan 30.336 titik yang tengah dilakukan pembangunan fisik.

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Minister of Finance (Menkeu) Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa confirmed that he would not increase tax rates while ensuring that the APBN deficit would remain under 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nPurbaya's statement was expressed in response to a report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which among other things proposed an increase in employee income tax (PPh) so that the APBN deficit does not exceed the 3% limit.\n\nThis option is one of the IMF's illustrative instruments for Indonesia to reduce the government's dependence on deficit financing. This year, the government is targeting a deficit of IDR 689.1 trillion or 2.68% of GDP.\n\n\"Yes, that's good, the IMF's proposal is good for increasing taxes. Do you want to be taxed? I said that until the economy is strong, we won't change tax rates. But we will extensify it, close tax leaks and so on,\" explained Purbaya to journalists after a coordination meeting (coordination meeting) of the Sumatra Post-Disaster Recovery Task Force with the DPR at the Senayan Parliament Complex, Jakarta, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nPurbaya ensured that the government focused on accelerating economic growth. For your information, from the 2026 baseline economic growth in the APBN Law of 5.4%, Purbaya estimates that the economy can grow up to 6% this year.\n\nWith the economy growing faster, he believes government tax revenues could be higher.  \"So the 3% [fiscal deficit limit] can be avoided automatically. If it's less, we'll increase taxes,\" he said jokingly.\n\nAlso Read\n\nThe economist, who has worked at Danareksa and the Presidential Staff Office (KSP), emphasized that he does not want to suddenly increase taxes. This can affect purchasing power so that economic growth slows down.\n\n\"We also have to cut the 3% if the economy falls. So I have used the cheapest possible costs to reverse the direction of the economy,\" he explained.\n\nPreviously, the IMF, through its Selected Issues Paper report entitled Golden Vision 2045: Making The Most Out of Public Investment, which was released in early February 2026, estimated that Indonesia needed real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% every year for the next two decades to achieve high-income country status in accordance with the vision of Golden Indonesia 2045.\n\nTo achieve that, the IMF identified increasing public investment as its main pillar. However, capital expenditure expansion must be accompanied by an increase in tax revenues so that the APBN deficit does not exceed the 3% threshold of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThe IMF report underlines that revenue mobilization is an absolute requirement to create loose fiscal space for the expansion of infrastructure and public projects.\n\n\"Mobilization of additional revenues will create the fiscal space needed to increase the scale of public investment while maintaining compliance with Indonesia's long-standing fiscal rules,\" explained the IMF research team consisting of Tsendsuren Batsuuri, Raju Huidrom and Philippe Wingender in the report, quoted on Saturday (14/2/2026).\n\nIn the framework of its macroeconomic simulations, the institution headquartered in Washington D.C. It projects that various domestic revenue extraction measures could contribute incremental state revenues of around 0.3 percentage points of GDP.\n\nAs an illustrative instrument, the IMF model offers the option of increasing employee income tax (labor income tax) to reduce the government's dependence on deficit financing.\n\nHowever, the IMF provides thick notes regarding the stages of the execution of this tax policy. The IMF formulated that the initial surge in public investment funding be financed entirely through the budget deficit. As time goes by and the wheels of the economy begin to turn faster due to this investment, labor income tax collection is gradually increased.\n\nDelay strategy be This initial tax ban is considered crucial so that tax pressure does not injure or put a brake on the rate of economic growth which is just about to take off.\n\nThrough a combination of these maneuvers, the overall fiscal deficit posture is believed to be maintained below 3%, based on the baseline of the 2024 APBN deficit realization at the level of 2.3% of GDP.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Menteri Keuangan (Menkeu) Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa memastikan belum akan menaikkan tarif pajak sembari memastikan defisit APBN tetap akan terjaga di bawah 3% dari produk domestik bruto (PDB).\n\nPernyataan Purbaya itu diungkapkan merespons laporan Dana Moneter Internasional atau International Monetary Fund (IMF) yang di antaranya mengusulkan kenaikan pajak penghasilan (PPh) karyawan agar defisit APBN tak melewati batas 3%.\n\nOpsi tersebut menjadi salah satu instrumen ilustratif IMF kepada Indonesia untuk mengurangi ketergantungan pemerintah pada pembiayaan defisit. Pada tahun ini, pemerintah menargetkan defisit Rp689,1 triliun atau 2,68% terhadap PDB.\n\n\"Ya bagus, usulan IMF itu bagus untuk naikin pajak. Anda mau dipajakin? Kan saya bilang sebelum ekonominya kuat, kami enggak akan ubah-ubah itu tarif pajak. Tetapi kami akan ekstensifikasi, tutup kebocoran pajak dan lain-lain,\" terang Purbaya kepada wartawan usai rapat koordinasi (rakor) Satgas Pemulihan Pascabencana Sumatra bersama DPR di Kompleks Parlemen Senayan, Jakarta, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nPurbaya memastikan bahwa pemerintah fokus untuk mempercepat pertumbuhan ekonomi. Untuk diketahui, dari baseline pertumbuhan ekonomi 2026 pada UU APBN sebesar 5,4%, Purbaya memperkirakan ekonomi bisa tumbuh sampai dengan 6% tahun ini.\n\nDengan perekonomian yang tumbuh lebih cepat, dia meyakini penerimaan pajak pemerintah bisa lebih tinggi.  \"Sehingga [batas defisit fiskal] 3% itu bisa dihindari secara otomatis. Nanti kalau kurang, ya kami naikin pajak,\" ujarnya sambil berkelakar.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nEkonom yang pernah bekerja di Danareksa hingga Kantor Staf Presiden (KSP) itu menegaskan tidak ingin secara tiba-tiba menaikkan pajak. Itu bisa memengaruhi daya beli sehingga pertumbuhan ekonomi pun melambat.\n\n\"Terpaksa 3% juga diterabas kalau ekonomi jatuh loh. Jadi saya sudah pakai biaya yang semurah mungkin untuk membalikkan arah ekonomi,\" terangnya.\n\nSebelumnya, IMF melalui laporan Selected Issues Paper bertajuk Golden Vision 2045: Making The Most Out of Public Investment yang dirilis awal Februari 2026, menaksir Indonesia membutuhkan pertumbuhan produk domestik bruto (PDB) riil di kisaran 5,5% hingga 6,5% setiap tahunnya selama dua dekade ke depan untuk mencapai status negara berpendapatan tinggi sesuai visi Indonesia Emas 2045.\n\nUntuk mencapai itu, IMF mengidentifikasi peningkatan investasi publik sebagai pilar utamanya. Kendati demikian, ekspansi belanja modal itu wajib berbarengan dengan peningkatan penerimaan pajak agar defisit APBN tidak melampaui ambang batas 3% terhadap produk domestik bruto (PDB).\n\nLaporan IMF menggarisbawahi bahwa mobilisasi penerimaan adalah syarat mutlak guna menciptakan ruang fiskal yang longgar bagi ekspansi proyek infrastruktur dan publik.\n\n\"Mobilisasi tambahan penerimaan akan menciptakan ruang fiskal yang dibutuhkan untuk meningkatkan skala investasi publik sembari mempertahankan kepatuhan terhadap aturan fiskal Indonesia yang telah berjalan lama,\" papar tim peneliti IMF yang beranggotakan Tsendsuren Batsuuri, Raju Huidrom, dan Philippe Wingender dalam laporan tersebut, dikutip Sabtu (14/2/2026).\n\nDalam kerangka simulasi makroekonominya, lembaga yang bermarkas di Washington D.C. tersebut memproyeksikan bahwa berbagai langkah ekstraksi penerimaan domestik dapat menyumbang tambahan pendapatan negara secara bertahap sekitar 0,3 poin persentase dari PDB.\n\nSebagai salah satu instrumen ilustratif, model IMF menyodorkan opsi peningkatan pajak penghasilan karyawan (labor income tax) untuk mengurangi ketergantungan pemerintah pada pembiayaan defisit.\n\nMeski demikian, IMF memberikan catatan tebal terkait tahapan dari eksekusi kebijakan perpajakan ini. IMF merumuskan agar lonjakan awal pendanaan investasi publik dibiayai sepenuhnya lewat defisit anggaran. Seiring dengan berjalannya waktu dan roda ekonomi yang mulai berputar lebih kencang akibat investasi tersebut, barulah penarikan pajak penghasilan tenaga kerja ditingkatkan secara bertahap.\n\nStrategi penundaan beban pajak di awal ini dinilai krusial agar tekanan pajak tidak mencederai atau mengerem laju pertumbuhan ekonomi yang baru saja akan lepas landas.\n\nMelalui kombinasi manuver tersebut, postur defisit fiskal secara keseluruhan diyakini akan tetap terjaga di bawah 3%, berdasarkan baseline realisasi defisit APBN 2024 di level 2,3% dari PDB.",

One of them is that domestic demand is still in the recovery stage, making business players maintain expansion so that it remains in line with market needs.\n\nApart from that, continued Erwin, this cautious attitude is also in line with global uncertainty ranging from the dynamics of interest rates, geopolitics, to the weakening of world trade which has also suppressed the business world's interest in new financing, especially foreign exchange-based financing.\n\nAt the same time, the business world also needs to maintain healthy cash flow and financial structure so that it is more selective in adding leverage. Even so, Erwin emphasized that this condition does not mean that the business world has stopped expansion plans.\n\nAlso Read\n\n\"Many business actors are currently waiting for the right momentum, regulatory certainty, and projects that have high leverage against demand,\" he said.\n\nFor this reason, Kadin hopes that the existence of Danantara can present projects that are bankable and have a big impact on job creation, as well as strengthening partnerships between BUMN and the private sector and attracting new investment, both from within and outside the country.\n\nApart from that, the business world hopes that Danantara will be able to present projects with a high multiplier effect, especially in the processing industry, productive infrastructure, energy and food security sectors.\n\nApart from that, Kadin also encourages private participation to be opened widely and transparently so as to create crowding-in investment, not crowding-out, as well as strengthening innovative financing schemes to reduce project risks and increase investment feasibility.\n\n\"With these steps, we are optimistic that the expansion of the business world will increase again in line with the creation of feasible projects, increasing demand, and maintaining macroeconomic stability,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, he said, Kadin is ready to work together to encourage the government's economic growth targets through increasing investment, strengthening the real sector and creating jobs.",

Pada dasarnya, mereka menggugat masuknya program prioritas pemerintah itu ke anggaran pendidikan yang diamanatkan konstitusi 20% dari APBN.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nApabila merujuk pada Peraturan Presiden (Perpres) No.118/2025 tentang Rincian Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara (APBN) 2026, total anggaran pendidikan tahun ini melalui belanja kementerian/lembaga, transfer ke daerah (TD) serta pembiayaan secara keseluruhan mencapai Rp769 triliun.\n\nAngka itu sudah 20% dari total belanja negara pada APBN 2026 yang ditetapkan Rp3.842,7 triliun. Adapun pemerintah menganggarkan Rp223,5 triliun untuk anggaran MBG yang dialokasikan melalui BGN atau sekitar 29% dari total anggaran pendidikan.\n\nAdapun tiga gugatan ke MK itu diajukan pada Januari dan Februari 2026 usai pemerintah mengunggah Perpres No.118/2025 awal tahun ini. Masing-masing adalah perkara No.55/PUU-XXIV/2026, No.52/PUU-XXIV/2026 dan No.40/PUU-XXIV/2026.\n\nUji materi terbaru yang diajukan ke MK adalah No.55/PUU-XXIV/2026 dari seorang guru bernama Reza Sudrajat. Judicial review yang dimohonkan ke MK yakni pasal 22 ayat (2) dan ayat (3) Undang-Undang (UU) No.17/2025 tentang APBN 2026. Reza meminta agar MK menyatakan pasal yang mencantumkan anggaran pendidikan 20% dari APBN itu inkonstitusional bersyarat.\n\n\"Menyatakan inkonstitusional bersyarat sepanjang tidak dimaknai: Besaran Anggaran Pendidikan sekurang-kurangnya 20% (dua puluh persen) adalah untuk fungsi penyelenggaraan pendidikan nasional (pedagogis), yang tidak mencakup anggaran program logistik pangan/Makan Bergizi Gratis (MBG) dan/atau anggaran Badan Gizi Nasional,\" bunyi petitum yang diajukan Reza ke MK, dikutip Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nReza menilai 20% anggaran pendidikan pada APBN 2026 bukanlah 'pendidikan murni'. Dia berkesimpulan bahwa pada dasarnya alokasi APBN bagi pendidikan sebenarnya 11,9%.",

With a total 2026 Village Fund of IDR 60.57 trillion, the remaining regular ceiling for other village development programs has shrunk to around IDR 25 trillion.\n\nNevertheless, Purbaya was not surprised to hear this figure. According to him, the 2026 Village Fund allocation for KDMP is even higher. \"My count is bigger than that [58%],\" said Purbaya at the Senayan Parliament Complex, Jakarta, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nThe state treasurer also asked for time to ensure more certainty regarding the new Village Fund structure regulations this year. He admitted that he would check the numbers again.\n\nPreviously, President Prabowo Subianto said that the use of Village Funds was deemed ineffective.\n\nAccording to Prabowo, inefficiencies and indications of Village Fund distribution have been ongoing for the last decade. He assessed that trillions of rupiah in state money had failed to transform into real prosperity at the grassroots.\n\nAlso Read\n\n\"For the past 10 years we have to admit that a lot of these funds have not reached the people. This is proven by the many village heads who have been forced to face the law because they cannot be properly accounted for in the use of these funds,\" said Prabowo at the Indonesia Economic Outlook 2026 event at Wisma Danantara, South Jakarta, Friday (13/2/2026).\n\nFor this reason, the head of state and government mandated the formation of KDMP as a new economic engine at the village level which is expected to have more measurable and accountable governance.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of village leadership organizations asked to meet Prabowo following the government's decision to allocate 58.03% of the 2026 village fund ceiling for the Red and White Village Cooperative program, aka KDMP.\n\nThis demand was conveyed directly by the leaders of six village head organizations (Kades) and the village consultative body (BPD) to the Minister of Villages and Development of Disadvantaged Regions (Mendes PDT) Yandri Susanto. They held a meeting on Monday (16/2/2026).\n\nChairman of the Central Leadership Council of the Association of Indonesian Village Heads (DPP AKSI) Irawadi said that the meeting was held following the village leaders' concerns regarding President Prabowo Subianto's statement highlighting the ineffectiveness of the use of Village Funds, as well as responding to the issuance of a new Ministry of Finance regulation requiring 58% of Village Funds for the KDMP program.\n\nIrawadi openly admitted that the series of issues, especially Prabowo's statement, had disturbed the spiritual situation of village heads at the grassroots.\n\n\"The President's statement, yes, it is clear, it is clearly disturbing, it has made the village head's friends from the lower levels uneasy,\" he said to Bisnis, Wednesday (18/3/2026).\n\nDuring the meeting, Irawadi said that PDT Village Minister Yandri Susanto was trying to calm the village leaders. According to Yandri, he continued, Prabowo's statement was only to motivate village officials to work harder.\n\n\"But how can you be enthusiastic, if the Village Fund which is the means for developing the village has been completely cut and diverted?\" said Irawadi.",

Dengan total Dana Desa 2026 sebesar Rp60,57 triliun, sisa pagu reguler untuk program pembangunan desa lainnya menyusut menjadi sekitar Rp25 triliun.\n\nKendati demikian, Purbaya tidak kaget mendengar angka tersebut. Menurutnya, alokasi Dana Desa 2026 untuk KDMP bahkan lebih tinggi lagi. \"Hitungan saya lebih besar dari itu [58%],\" ujar Purbaya di Kompleks Parlemen Senayan, Jakarta, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nBendahara negara itu pun meminta waktu untuk memastikan lebih pasti terkait aturan baru struktur Dana Desa tahun ini. Dia mengaku akan mengecek angka itu lagi.\n\nAdapun sebelumnya, penggunaan Dana Desa yang dirasa tidak efektif sudah disampaikan secara terbuka oleh Presiden Prabowo Subianto.\n\nMenurut Prabowo, inefisiensi dan indikasi penyaluran Dana Desa telah berjalan selama satu dekade terakhir. Dia menilai triliunan rupiah uang negara gaga bertransformasi menjadi kesejahteraan nyata di akar rumput.\n\nBaca Juga\n\n\"Selama ini 10 tahun kita harus akui banyak dana tersebut tidak sampai ke rakyat.

Menurut Yandri, sambungnya, pernyataan Prabowo hanya untuk memotivasi para perangkat desa agar bekerja lebih keras.\n\n\"Tapi bagaimana mau semangat, kalau Dana Desa-nya saja yang menjadi sarana untuk membangun desa sudah habis dipotong untuk dialihkan?\" ujar Irawadi.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — This year's Chinese New Year celebration marks the end of the Year of the Wooden Snake and the start of the Year of the Fire Horse, which is a symbol of hope about energy, speed and a burning spirit.\n\nIn the Chinatown area, Jakarta, the typical excitement of Chinese New Year celebrations is very strong. However, behind the red ornaments and the rush of Chinese New Year celebrations in Chinatown, there is an energy that flows quietly and inaudibly.\n\nThe energy is natural gas from PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk. (PGN), which revives spiritual activities in the area.\n\nSilent underground, natural gas from the issuer with the stock code PGAS has been flowing towards the Avalokitesvara Monastery since 2015, supporting various daily activities there.\n\nSo far, energy has often been associated with sources that ignite the fire of productivity and drive the wheels of the economy. However, for PGN as Pertamina Gas Subholding, natural gas is also present to serve the social and religious needs of the community.\n\nPGN Jakarta Area Head, Mohammad Makki Nuruddin, said that the presence of natural gas at the Avalokitesvara Vihara is proof that energy services are not only intended for households and business people, but are also part of maintaining peace amidst the hustle and bustle of the city of Jakarta.\n\n\"The presence of natural gas at the Avalokitesvara Vihara is a form of our support for the community's solemnity in worship. We hope that natural gas can help manage energy more efficiently and optimally for the monastery management, so that all rituals and social religious activities can run smoothly,\" said Makki in his statement, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nHe added that the natural gas service at the monastery shows PGN's commitment to providing energy access regardless of customer background. Moreover, PGN's main focus is to provide easy access to energy for various groups of society.\n\nMakki hopes that the presence of natural gas services in places of worship can help foster a spirit of tolerance and harmony in the surrounding environment. \"We prioritize quality services with a good level of security, thereby providing peace of mind in worship. As a cleaner energy, natural gas is expected to be in line with the philosophical values ​​of the monastery which upholds harmony with nature,\" said Makki.\n\nAs an illustration, with an average usage of 150–200 m³ per month, natural gas is able to support the kitchen operations of the Avalokitesvara Temple. \"Usually we use it to cook three meals a day for the teachers and employees. On prayer or service days, the amount can reach 300-350 portions,\" said Wiwit, one of the Avalokitesvara Vihara cooks.\n\nMeanwhile, the availability of PGN natural gas that flows 24 hours a day also ensures a stable flame for daily cooking needs and during religious activities.",

Namun, di balik ornamen merah dan derap perayaan Imlek di kawasan Pecinan, terdapat energi yang mengalir dengan tenang dan tak terdengar.\n\nEnergi itu adalah gas bumi dari PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk. (PGN), yang menghidupkan aktivitas spiritual di kawasan tersebut.\n\nSenyap di bawah tanah,gas bumidari emiten berkode saham PGAS tersebut sejak 2015 lalu mengalir menuju Vihara Avalokitesvara, mendukung berbagai aktivitas keseharian di dalamnya.\n\nSelama ini, energi kerap dihubungkan dengan sumber yang memantik api produktivitas dan menggerakkan roda ekonomi. Namun, bagi PGN sebagai Subholding Gas Pertamina, gas bumi juga hadir untuk melayani kebutuhan sosial dan keagamaan masyarakat.\n\nArea Head PGN Jakarta, Mohammad Makki Nuruddin menyebut, kehadiran gas bumi di Vihara Avalokitesvara menjadi bukti bahwa layanan energi tidak hanya diperuntukkan bagi rumah tangga dan pelaku usaha, tetapi juga menjadi bagian dari penjaga kedamaian di tengah hiruk-pikuk Kota Jakarta.\n\n“Kehadiran gas bumi di Vihara Avalokitesvara merupakan wujud dukungan kami terhadap kekhidmatan masyarakat dalam beribadah. Kami berharap, gas bumi dapat membantu pengelolaan energi yang lebih efisien dan optimal bagi pengelola vihara, sehingga seluruh ritual maupun kegiatan sosial keagamaan dapat berjalan lancar,” kata Makki dalam keterangannya, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nDia menambahkan bahwa layanan gas bumi di vihara tersebut menunjukkan komitmen PGN dalam memberikan akses energi tanpa membedakan latar belakang pelanggan. Terlebih, fokus utama PGN adalah menghadirkan kemudahan akses energi bagi berbagai kalangan masyarakat.\n\nMakki mengharapkan dengan adanya layanan gas bumi di rumah ibadah dapat turut memupuk semangat toleransi dan harmoni di lingkungan sekitar. “Kami mengedepankan layanan yang berkualitas dengan tingkat keamanan yang baik, sehingga memberikan ketenangan dalam beribadah. Sebagai energi yang lebih bersih, gas bumi diharapkan selaras dengan nilai filosofis vihara yang menjunjung harmoni dengan alam,” ujar Makki.\n\nSebagai gambaran, dengan rata-rata pemakaian 150–200 m³ per bulan, gas bumi mampu mendukung operasional dapur Vihara Avalokitesvara. “Biasanya kami gunakan untuk memasak tiga kali sehari bagi para suhu dan karyawan. Saat hari sembahyang atau kebaktian, jumlahnya bisa mencapai 300–350 porsi,” kata Wiwit, salah satu juru masak Vihara Avalokitesvara.\n\nAdapun, ketersediaan gas bumi PGN yang mengalir 24 jam turut memastikan nyala api yang stabil untuk kebutuhan memasak sehari-hari maupun saat kegiatan keagamaan berlangsung.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Minister of Finance Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa dismissed the notion that private business actors are holding back the pace of business expansion at the end of 2025, despite a decline in the position of External Debt (ULN).\n\nFor the record, Bank Indonesia (BI) data shows that private external debt in the fourth quarter of 2025 was recorded at US192.78 billion. This figure is lower than the achievement in the third quarter of 2025 which was at the level of US194.48 billion, marking the lowest position in the last four years.\n\nResponding to this trend, Purbaya assessed that the decline in private external debt could not necessarily be translated as an indicator of sluggishness in the business world. He requested that the reading of economic data not be carried out in a partial manner, but rather pay attention to monthly movements and quarterly cycles of economic activity.\n\n\"Do you see what it's like from month to month? I'm sure it goes down every first, second and third quarter, then in the fourth quarter it starts to rise again in line with economic activity. In the future it will be even better,\" he said at the Senayan Parliament Complex, Jakarta, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nThis belief refers to the realization of economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2025 which reached 5.39%. This figure is higher than the previous quarters last year.\n\nFurthermore, the state treasurer views that the reduction in debt withdrawals from abroad by the private sector is in line with the government's strategy of flooding domestic banks with liquidity.\n\nAlso Read\n\nAccording to him, the abundant availability of funds in the country means that corporations have the option to switch to using financing from local banks.\n\n\"Maybe they [business actors] also see that in the country there is more funding from banks, because we are encouraging liquidity into the economic system, right? So, the translation is not one way like that [the private sector is holding back expansion],\" said Purbaya.\n\nThroughout the second half of 2025, Purbaya was observed to be aggressive in diverting state cash stored at the central bank to be distributed to commercial banks to stimulate credit distribution.\n\nIt was recorded that the initial injection was made of IDR 200 trillion to state-owned banks (Bank Mandiri, BNI, BRI, BTN) and BSI on September 12 2025. The government then again injected IDR 76 trillion on November 10 2025.\n\nEven though Purbaya had withdrawn funds amounting to IDR 75 trillion last December, the remaining state cash that was still sitting as liquidity ammunition in the domestic banking system was still recorded to be very large, reaching IDR 201 trillion.\n\nFor the record, Bank Indonesia (BI) reported that banking credit grew 9.69% on an annual basis (year on year/YoY) in 2025. Even though it was in the target range of 8-11% YoY, the realization was still lower than banking credit growth in the previous period or 2024 of 10.39%.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Menteri Keuangan Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa menepis anggapan pelaku usaha swasta sedang menahan laju ekspansi bisnisnya pada penghujung 2025, meski terjadi penurunan posisi Utang Luar Negeri (ULN).\n\nSebagai catatan, data Bank Indonesia (BI) menunjukkan posisi ULN swasta pada kuartal IV/2025 tercatat senilai US192,78 miliar. Angka ini susut dibandingkan dengan capaian pada kuartal III/2025 yang berada di level US194,48 miliar, sekaligus menandai posisi terendah dalam empat tahun terakhir.\n\nMerespons tren tersebut, Purbaya menilai turunnya ULN swasta itu tidak bisa serta-merta diterjemahkan sebagai indikator kelesuan dunia usaha. Dia meminta agar pembacaan data ekonomi tidak dilakukan secara parsial, melainkan memperhatikan pergerakan bulanan dan siklus aktivitas ekonomi kuartalan.\n\n\"Anda lihat tidak dari bulan ke bulan seperti apa? Saya yakin turunnya setiap triwulan pertama, kedua, dan ketiga, lalu pada kuartal keempat mulai naik lagi sesuai dengan aktivitas ekonomi. Ke depan akan lebih bagus lagi,\" ujarnya di Kompleks Parlemen Senayan, Jakarta, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nKeyakinan tersebut merujuk realisasi pertumbuhan ekonomi kuartal IV/2025 yang mencapai 5,39%. Angka tersebut lebih tinggi dari kuartal-kuartal sebelumnya pada tahun lalu.\n\nLebih lanjut, bendahara negara memandang penyusutan penarikan utang dari luar negeri oleh pihak swasta justru sejalan dengan strategi pemerintah yang membanjiri perbankan domestik dengan likuiditas.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nMenurutnya, ketersediaan dana yang melimpah di dalam negeri membuat korporasi memiliki opsi untuk beralih menggunakan pembiayaan dari perbankan lokal.\n\n\"Mungkin mereka [pelaku usaha] juga melihat di dalam negeri sudah lebih banyak funding dari perbankan, karena kita dorong likuiditas ke sistem perekonomian kan? Jadi, terjemahannya tidak satu arah seperti itu [swasta menahan ekspansi],\" tegas Purbaya.\n\nSepanjang paruh kedua 2025, Purbaya memang terpantau agresif mengalihkan kas negara yang tersimpan di bank sentral untuk disalurkan ke bank umum guna memacu penyaluran kredit.\n\nTercatat, injeksi perdana dilakukan sebesar Rp200 triliun ke bank pelat merah (Bank Mandiri, BNI, BRI, BTN) dan BSI pada 12 September 2025. Pemerintah kemudian kembali menyuntikkan dana Rp76 triliun pada 10 November 2025.\n\nKendati Purbaya sempat menarik kembali dana sebesar Rp75 triliun pada Desember lalu, sisa kas negara yang masih mengendap sebagai amunisi likuiditas di sistem perbankan domestik tercatat masih sangat tebal, yakni mencapai Rp201 triliun.\n\nSebagai catatan, Bank Indonesia (BI) melaporkan kredit perbankan tumbuh 9,69% secara tahunan (year on year/YoY) pada 2025. Meski berada di kisaran target 8-11% YoY, namun realisasi itu tetap lebih rendah dibandingkan pertumbuhan kredit perbankan periode sebelumnya atau 2024 sebesar 10,39%.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA —The World Bank has highlighted the condition of Indonesian manufacturing which is considered to be experiencing slow growth, especially for high value added industries and weakening sectoral productivity.\n\nThe document entitled Country Growth & Jobs Report: Indonesia, which was released by the World Bank at the end of January 2026, states that even though productivity is slowing, manufacturing still absorbs 22% of the national workforce.\n\nInstitute For Development of Economics and Finance (Indef) researcher Ariyo DP Irhamna said the World Bank's concerns could also be seen from the decline in added value of Indonesian manufacturing which was recorded at 18.67% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 or down from 22.1% in 2011.\n\n\"The World Bank is worried because this means that each manufacturing worker produces less and less value, labor productivity is falling, not rising,\" said Ariyo to Bisnis, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nIn the same report, it was stated that around 70% of investment realization went to the manufacturing sector with low added value. The industrial structure in Indonesia is still dominated by commodity-based processing.\n\nIt is said that much of Indonesia's investment realization has been sucked into the processed food industry, basic metals, as well as accommodation and food services due to the push of the commodity cycle.\n\nAlso Read\n\nCurrent conditions are inversely proportional to the flow of capital to export-oriented and high-value manufacturing, such as automotive, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and information and communications technology (ICT). In fact, the World Bank explains that these sectors became prime investment targets in the early to mid-1990s, driven by trade reform and deregulation.\n\nThe problem is, after that, there was a trend of market restrictions in the country. As a result, according to the World Bank, this phenomenon is the cause of the decline in Indonesia's manufacturing productivity by 20% to 30% compared to its glory era in the early 1990s.\n\nThe World Bank recommends increasing business competition, improving the efficiency of resource allocation, strengthening the modern service sector, and accelerating digitalization.\n\nIndonesia is considered to need to encourage a shift in industrial structure from commodity-based and low labor-intensive to sectors with higher added value and technology-based.\n\nAccording to Ariyo, the current incoming investment has not changed the structure of Indonesia's manufacturing industry so that it remains undiversified and has not risen in level, dominated by natural resource-based products which are exported to many other countries.\n\n\"National industry must focus on sectors where domestic technological mastery already exists so that productivity can be directly boosted without relying too much on foreign technology transfers,\" he said.\n\nSeveral sectors need to be boosted, for example biotechnology-based agro-industry. Ariyo said that local palm oil, rubber and cocoa research institutions were mature. However, it needs to be accelerated commercially, not just basic research.\n\nSecond, the defense and aerospace industry which is currently being pioneered by PT Pindad, PT Dirgantara Indonesia, and PT PAL Indonesia with real engineering capabilities with widespread spillover effects into the civil sector. However, it needs to be supported by consistent domestic procurement.\n\nThird, standardized generic and herbal pharmaceuticals. In this case, Ariyo sees that state-owned companies such as Kimia Farma and Indofarma have mastered generic production.\n\n\"The next step is to move up to biosimilars and phytopharmaceuticals, an area where research by BRIN and state-owned pharmaceutical companies has produced prototypes that have not yet been commercialized,\" he concluded.",

Struktur industri di Indonesia juga masih didominasi pengolahan berbasis komoditas.\n\nRealisasi investasi Indonesia disebut banyak tersedot ke industri makanan olahan, logam dasar, serta layanan akomodasi dan makanan akibat dorongan siklus komoditas.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nKondisi saat ini berbanding terbalik dengan aliran modal ke manufaktur berorientasi ekspor dan bernilai tinggi, seperti otomotif, elektronik, farmasi, dan teknologi informasi dan komunikasi (TIK). Padahal, Bank Dunia menjelaskan sektor-sektor tersebut menjadi primadona investasi pada awal hingga pertengahan 1990-an, yang didorong oleh reformasi perdagangan dan deregulasi.\n\nMasalahnya, setelah itu, terjadi tren pembatasan pasar di Tanah Air. Akibatnya, menurut Bank Dunia, fenomena tersebut menjadi biang kerok anjloknya produktivitas manufaktur Indonesia sebesar 20% hingga 30% dibandingkan era kejayaannya di awal 1990-an.\n\nBank Dunia merekomendasikan peningkatan persaingan usaha, perbaikan efisiensi alokasi sumber daya, penguatan sektor jasa modern, serta percepatan digitalisasi.\n\nIndonesia dinilai perlu mendorong pergeseran struktur industri dari berbasis komoditas dan padat karya rendah menuju sektor dengan nilai tambah lebih tinggi dan berbasis teknologi.\n\nMenurut Ariyo, investasi yang masuk saat ini tidak mengubah struktur industri manufaktur Indonesia sehingga tetap tidak terdiversifikasi dan tidak naik tingkat, didominasi produk berbasis sumber daya alam yang diekspor banyak negara lain.\n\n\"Industri nasional harus fokus pada sektor di mana penguasaan teknologi domestik sudah ada sehingga produktivitas bisa langsung terdorong tanpa terlalu bergantung pada transfer teknologi asing,\" tuturnya.\n\nBeberapa sektor yang harus digenjot, misalnya agroindustri berbasis bioteknologi. Ariyo menyebut, lembaga riset sawit, karet, dan kakao lokal sudah matang. Namun, perlu dipercepat secara komersial, bukan lagi riset dasarnya.\n\nKedua, industri pertahanan dan kedirgantaraan yang saat ini dipionir oleh PT Pindad, PT Dirgantara Indonesia, dan PT PAL Indonesia dengan kapabilitas rekayasa nyata dengan efekspilloverluas ke sektor sipil. Namun, perlu didukung pengadaan domestik yang konsisten.\n\nKetiga, farmasi generik dan herbal terstandarisasi. Dalam hal ini, Ariyo melihat BUMN seperti Kimia Farma dan Indofarma telah menguasai produksi generik.\n\n\"Langkah berikutnya adalah naik kelas ke biosimilar dan fitofarmaka, area di mana riset BRIN beserta BUMN farmasi sudah menghasilkan prototipe yang belum dikomersialisasikan,\" pungkasnya.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — The Ministry of Trade (Kemendag) stated that it would increase the number of second brands of cooking oil along with the limited supply of Minyakita amidst pressure from rising prices of crude palm oil (CPO).\n\nMinister of Trade (Mendag) Budi Santoso said that before Minyakita was launched, the number of second brands on the market could reach around 50 brands, but then it shrank because demand was concentrated on Minyakita.\n\nCurrently the highest retail price (HET) for Minyakita is set at IDR 15,700 per liter, while other packaged cooking oil products are priced at around IDR 39,900 for two liters.\n\n\"We are increasing the number of second brands. So it is a companion oil to Minyakita. Previously, before Oilita there were 50 brands of second brands, after Oilita it decreased because everyone went to Oilita. So later we will increase it,\" said Budi when met at the Ministry of Trade Office, Jakarta, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nThis alternative product will be marketed in various small sizes, such as 500 milliliters to 300 milliliters, even in cup packaging at affordable prices, starting from IDR 5,000 per unit.\n\nThe Ministry of Trade hopes that this step can shift consumer focus from Minyakita, which has limited supply, while maintaining the stability of cooking oil prices in the retail market.\n\nAlso Read\n\nMoreover, Budi said that the price of CPO as a raw material has now increased, with the last price in Palembang recorded at IDR 14,035 per kilogram. The price is higher than the producer's distribution price to first level distributors (D1) which is set at IDR 13,500 per kilogram.\n\nOn the other hand, Budi emphasized that the supply of Minyakita cannot be expanded aggressively because it is very dependent on the domestic market obligation (DMO) policy which follows export volume. When exports decrease, the DMO allocation will automatically be limited, so that the supply of Minyakita in the market cannot be increased significantly.\n\n\"This means that Minyakita is indeed limited. That's why we are asking for more oil choices besides Minyakita,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the realization of DMO obligations is currently approaching 30%, with the average market price of Minyakita being around IDR 16,800 per liter.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — A number of village leadership organizations asked to meet with President Prabowo Subianto, following the government's decision to allocate 58.03% of the 2026 village fund ceiling for the Red and White Village Cooperative program, aka KDMP.\n\nThis demand was conveyed directly by the leaders of six village head organizations (Kades) and the village consultative body (BPD) to the Minister of Villages and Development of Disadvantaged Regions (Mendes PDT) Yandri Susanto. They held a meeting on Monday (16/2/2026).\n\nChairman of the Central Leadership Council of the Association of Indonesian Village Heads (DPP AKSI) Irawadi said that the meeting was held following the village leaders' concerns regarding President Prabowo Subianto's statement highlighting the ineffectiveness of the use of Village Funds, as well as responding to the issuance of a new Ministry of Finance regulation requiring 58% of Village Funds for the KDMP program.\n\nIrawadi openly admitted that the series of issues, especially Prabowo's statement, had disturbed the spiritual situation of village heads at the grassroots. In the agenda for the Indonesia Economic Outlook 2026 at the end of last week, Prabowo said Village Funds had \"not reached the people\" in the past decade.\n\n\"The President's statement, yes, it is clear, it is clearly disturbing, it has made the village head's friends from the lower levels anxious,\" he said to Bisnis, Wednesday (18/3/2026).\n\nDuring the meeting, Irawadi said that PDT Village Minister Yandri Susanto was trying to calm the village leaders. According to Yandri, he continued, Prabowo's statement was only to motivate village officials to work harder.\n\nAlso Read\n\n\"But how can you be enthusiastic, if the Village Fund which is the means for developing the village has been completely cut and diverted?\" said Irawadi.\n\nThe 'cut' itself started with the issuance of Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK) no. 7/2026 concerning Management of Village Funds for Fiscal Year 2026. This regulation mandates that 58.03% of the total Village Fund ceiling or around IDR 34.57 trillion, be transferred specifically to support the implementation of KDMP.\n\nWith these cuts, Irawadi projects that the remaining budget which is managed purely by villages will now only be around IDR 300 million per village. This figure is considered very unrealistic for carrying out physical development and increasing human resources at the village level.\n\nIrawadi also corrected the public's assumption that each village pocketed IDR 1 billion. In fact, many villages only receive IDR 600 million to IDR 700 million, the use of which is strictly regulated by the central government through standard regulations.\n\n\"This portion has been regulated centrally. So far, only 30% of the Village Fund can be the authority of the village head to build. When we don't follow the regulations, our [LPJ] accountability report will not be accepted,\" he stressed.\n\nResponding to this polemic, village organization leaders emphasized that the bureaucratic route through technical ministries was no longer felt to be effective. Irawadi said that previous meetings with the Minister of Villages for PDT and echelon I representatives at the Ministry of Finance had only resulted in normative discussions without concrete solutions.\n\nTherefore, the main point of the meeting with the Minister of Villages PDT some time ago was to urge the government to facilitate direct audiences between village organizations and President Prabowo Subianto.\n\n\"We want to be facilitated in meeting President Prabowo. At that meeting, we will convey directly the real situation of the village and the spiritual atmosphere of the village heads regarding his policies and statements,\" concluded Irawadi.\n\nOn the other hand, the policy of diverting funds for KDMP development has also raised new concerns in the field. Irawadi highlighted the potential death of local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) due to the presence of KDMP.\n\nThe problem is, KDMP businesses already exist in many villages, such as wholesalers and small community-owned shops. Nevertheless, he continued, the village leadership could not do much.\n\n\"Because this is the President's program and according to him it is better, we as officers \"You have to support it below and just see the results,\" he explained.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Sejumlah organisasi pimpinan desa meminta bertemu Presiden Prabowo Subianto, usai keputusan pemerintah yang mengalokasikan 58,03% pagu dana desa 2026 untuk program Koperasi Desa Merah Putih alias KDMP.\n\nTuntutan tersebut disampaikan langsung oleh pimpinan enam organisasi kepala desa (Kades) dan badan permusyawaratan desa (BPD) kepada Menteri Desa dan Pembangunan Daerah Tertinggal (Mendes PDT) Yandri Susanto. Mereka melakukan pertemuan pada Senin (16/2/2026).\n\nKetua Dewan Pimpinan Pusat Asosiasi Kepala Desa Seluruh Indonesia (DPP AKSI) Irawadi mengungkapkan pertemuan tersebut dilakukan menyusul keresahan para pimpinan desa atas pernyataan Presiden Prabowo Subianto yang menyoroti inefektivitas penggunaan Dana Desa, sekaligus merespons terbitnya regulasi baru Kementerian Keuangan yang mewajibkan 58% Dana Desa untuk program KDMP.\n\nIrawadi secara terang-terangan mengakui bahwa rentetan isu tersebut, terutama pernyataan Prabowo, telah mengusik situasi kebatinan para kepala desa di akar rumput. Dalam agendaIndonesia Economic Outlook 2026pada akhir pekan lalu, Prabowo menyebutkan Dana Desa \"tidak sampai ke rakyat\" dalam satu dekade belakang.\n\n\"Pernyataan Presiden, ya jelas itu, jelas mengusik lah ya, membuat gelisah para teman-teman Kades dari arus bawah\" ujarnya kepadaBisnis, Rabu (18/3/2026).\n\nDalam pertemuan, Irawadi menyampaikan Mendes PDT Yandri Susanto coba menenangkan para pimpinan desa. Menurut Yandri, sambungnya, pernyataan Prabowo hanya untuk memotivasi para perangkat desa agar bekerja lebih keras.\n\nBaca Juga\n\n\"Tapi bagaimana mau semangat, kalau Dana Desa-nya saja yang menjadi sarana untuk membangun desa sudah habis dipotong untuk dialihkan?\" ujar Irawadi.\n\n'Pemotongan' itu sendiri bermula dari terbitnya Peraturan Menteri Keuangan (PMK) No. 7/2026 tentang Pengelolaan Dana Desa Tahun Anggaran 2026. Beleid tersebut mengamanatkan 58,03% dari total pagu Dana Desa atau sekitar Rp34,57 triliun, dialihkan secara khusus untuk mendukung implementasi KDMP.\n\nDengan pemotongan tersebut, Irawadi memproyeksikan sisa anggaran yang dikelola murni oleh desa kini hanya tersisa sekitar Rp300-an juta per desa. Angka ini dinilai sangat tidak realistis untuk menjalankan pembangunan fisik maupun peningkatan sumber daya manusia di tingkat desa.\n\nIrawadi juga meluruskan asumsi publik bahwa setiap desa mengantongi Rp1 miliar. Faktanya, banyak desa yang hanya menerima Rp600 juta hingga Rp700 juta, yang penggunaannya pun sudah diatur ketat oleh pemerintah pusat melalui regulasi baku.\n\n\"Porsi itu sudah diatur dari pusat. Hanya 30% selama ini dari Dana Desa yang boleh menjadi kewenangan kepala desa untuk membangun. Di saat kita tidak ikuti sesuai regulasi, maka laporan pertanggungjawaban [LPJ] kita tidak diterima,\" tegasnya.\n\nMerespons polemik ini, para pimpinan organisasi desa menegaskan bahwa jalur birokrasi melalui kementerian teknis dirasa tidak lagi efektif. Irawadi menyebut pertemuan dengan Mendes PDT maupun perwakilan eselon I di Kementerian Keuangan yang sudah dilakukan sebelumnya hanya menghasilkan diskusi normatif tanpa solusi konkret.\n\nOleh karena itu, poin utama dari pertemuan dengan Mendes PDT beberapa waktu lalu adalah mendesak pemerintah untuk memfasilitasi audiensi langsung antara organisasi desa dengan Presiden Prabowo Subianto.\n\n\"Kami ingin difasilitasi bertemu Presiden Prabowo. Di saat pertemuan itu nanti, kami akan sampaikan langsung situasi riil desa dan suasana kebatinan para kades terkait kebijakan serta pernyataan beliau,\" pungkas Irawadi.\n\nDi sisi lain, kebijakan mengalihkan dana untuk pembangunan KDMP juga memunculkan kekhawatiran baru di lapangan. Irawadi menyoroti potensi matinya usaha mikro, kecil, dan menengah (UMKM) lokal akibat kehadiran KDMP.\n\nMasalahnya, usaha-usaha KDMP sudah ada di banyak desa seperti grosir maupun toko-toko kecil milik masyarakat. Kendati demikian, sambungnya, pimpinan desa tidak bisa berbuat banyak.\n\n\"Karena ini program Presiden dan menurut beliau lebih bagus, kita sebagai aparat di bawah harus mendukung dan melihat saja nanti hasilnya,\" jelasnya.",

In fact, according to the Indonesian Society of Appraisers (Mappi), property growth in Indonesia has reached 6-7%.\n\nMappi administrator, Harizul Akbar Nazwar, assesses that there is a shift in trends in the property market.

From what was previously community-driven to now infrastructure-driven,\" explained Harizul in the Factory Hub Business podcast program, some time ago.\n\nCurrently, people choose to buy property considering distance, adequate infrastructure facilities, and easy access to transportation compared to expensive property as an investment asset.\n\nHarizul said that the property sector is one of the most important sectors for Indonesia, considering that its contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) reaches 14-15%.

The lure of this policy includes people's business credit, aka KUR Housing, with a 5% government interest subsidy, as well as an extension of the 100% government-borne value added tax incentive (VAT DTP) until 2027 which applies to houses priced up to IDR 5 billion.\n\n\"Even though our interest rate trend is also relatively down, now at 4.75 basis points and has fallen by around, if I'm not mistaken, almost 1% compared to last year, [but] it still feels insufficient,\" said Harizul.\n\nEven these policy efforts have not yet yielded results. The sluggish property sector is also caused by structural problems, such as weakening purchasing power and economic uncertainty.\n\n\"But there is one paradigm that is quite interesting. There is also a trend of young people now avoiding home ownership,\" added Harizul.\n\nIndonesia itself is still facing a shortage, aka a backlog of home ownership of up to 15 million units. Regarding this, the government offers a solution through the 3 million houses program.\n\nHowever, once again, developers are worried that people will not be interested in buying properties that have already been built. Harizul also encouraged the government to not only improve the supply side, but also the demand side.\n\nOn the other hand, the middle class group is increasingly squeezed because it does not have as solid a foundation as the upper class, but also does not receive as much assistance from the government as low-income people (MBR) receive. In fact, this segment is targeted as potential consumers.\n\nAccording to Harizul, people, especially the younger generation, consider long-term risks, for example income and ability to pay in installments. \"These things make people, especially first home buyers, relatively less confident in deciding whether to buy now or not.\"\n\nIn order to realize the success of the 3 million houses program, Harizul encouraged the government to issue measurable policies with optimal outreach to the community.\n\nMeanwhile, from the developer's side, he suggested that non-cash incentives be prepared for the community. For example, price cuts or conversion into household appliances for the lower middle class.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA – Sektor properti Indonesia terus menunjukan kinerja yang melambat, harga residensial tercatat terus menurun sejak 2024.\n\nBank for International Settlements mencatat harga properti residensial di Indonesia anjlok dari 1,46% pada kuartal III/2024 menjadi 0,8% pada kuartal III/2025. Padahal, menurut Masyarakat Profesi Penilai Indonesia (Mappi) pertumbuhan properti Tanah Air pernah mencapai 6–7%.\n\nPengurus Mappi, Harizul Akbar Nazwar, menilai adanya pergeseran tren dalam pasar properti. Kini, alih-alih bergantung pada ekspektasi, pasar properti justru didorong oleh realitas maupun kebutuhan.\n\n“Jadi sebagai kebutuhan primer, dia pasti dicari. Tapi pasarnya ternyata sudah bergerak. Dari yang tadinya community-driven sekarang ke infrastructure-driven,” jelas Harizul dalam program siniar Factory Hub Bisnis, beberapa waktu lalu.\n\nSaat ini, masyarakat memilih untuk membeli properti dengan pertimbangan jarak, sarana infrastruktur memadai, hingga kemudahan akses transportasi dibandingkan properti dengan harga mahal sebagai aset investasi.\n\nHarizul menyebut sektor properti merupakan salah satu sektor terpenting bagi Indonesia, mengingat kontribusinya terhadap produk domestik bruto (PDB) mencapai 14–15%. Oleh karena itu, menurutnya, properti harus dilihat sebagai sebuah alat kebijakan bukan hanya sektor ekonomi saja.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nMaka, tak heran pemerintah sampai mengguyur sektor properti dengan berbagai insentif. Iming-iming kebijakan itu meliputi kredit usaha rakyat alias KUR Perumahan dengan subsidi bunga pemerintah 5%, serta perpanjangan insentif pajak pertambahan nilai ditanggung pemerintah (PPN DTP) 100% hingga 2027 yang berlaku untuk rumah dengan harga sampai Rp5 miliar.\n\n“Meskipun tren suku bunga kita juga relatif turun, sekarang di 4,75 basis poin dan sudah turun sekitar kalau nggak salah hampir 1% di-comparetahun lalu, [tapi] masih dirasa belum mencukupi,” ujar Harizul.\n\nUpaya kebijakan itupun belum menuai hasil. Persoalan sektor properti yang lesu juga disebabkan masalah struktural, seperti pelemahan daya beli hingga ketidakpastian ekonomi.\n\n“Tapi ada satu paradigma yang cukup menarik. Ada juga tren anak muda sekarang yang menghindari kepemilikan rumah,” tambah Harizul.\n\nIndonesia sendiri masih berhadapan dengan kekurangan alias backlog kepemilikan rumah hingga 15 juta unit. Terkait hal ini, pemerintah menawarkan solusi lewat program 3 juta rumah.\n\nKendati begitu, kembali lagi, para pengembang khawatir masyarakat tidak tertarik untuk membeli properti yang sudah dibangun. Harizul pun mendorong pemerintah agar tidak hanya membenahi supply side, tetapi juga demand side.\n\nDi sisi lain, kelompok kelas menengah makin terhimpit lantaran tidak memiliki fondasi sekokoh kelas atas, tetapi juga tidak mendapatkan banyak bantuan dari pemerintah sebagaimana yang diterima masyarakat berpenghasilan rendah (MBR). Padahal, segmen inilah yang disasar sebagai konsumen potensial.\n\nMenurut Harizul, masyarakat khususnya generasi lebih muda mempertimbangkan risiko jangka panjang, misalnya pendapatan dan kemampuan untuk mencicil. “Hal-hal ini yang membuat masyarakat, khususnya first home buyer menjadi relatif kurang confident untuk menentukan apakah saya beli sekarang atau enggak.”\n\nDemi mewujudkan keberhasilan program 3 juta rumah, Harizul mendorong pemerintah agar mengeluarkan kebijakan terukur dengan sosialisasi optimal kepada masyarakat.\n\nSementara itu, dari sisi pengembang, dia menyarankan agar dipersiapkan insentif non tunai untuk masyarakat. Seperti, potongan harga maupun dikonversi menjadi alat rumah tangga bagi kelas menengah ke bawah.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — The Ministry of Trade (Kemendag) denies that the Free Nutritious Meal Program (MBG) has caused the supply of purebred chicken eggs and chicken meat to run low on the market.\n\nMinister of Trade (Mendag) Budi Santoso said that MBG actually creates demand certainty which makes poultry production move more stably and measurably.\n\n\"No, it's like this. I've actually discussed this with friends. In the past, prices went up and down because demand went up and down. Demand went up and down, prices went up and down,\" said Budi when met at the Ministry of Trade Office, Jakarta, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nAccording to Budi, with MBG, demand becomes more certain so that producers can adjust production linearly according to needs. This condition, he continued, actually makes prices tend to be stable and not volatile.\n\nFurthermore, Budi also dismissed MBG as triggering a spike in food prices in the market. According to him, there is no evidence of a sudden price increase due to the program.\n\n\"Guys, let's see, are there a lot of them and then suddenly prices jump because of MBG? There aren't any. All the prices are good too,\" he said.\n\nAlso Read\n\nMeanwhile, Budi stated that the government had discussed with various stakeholders, including business actors and MSMEs. From the results of the meeting, MBG was assessed as having a positive impact because production increased in line with sustainable demand.\n\nIn Business Notes, Agricultural Observer from the Center of Reform on Economics (Core) Indonesia, Eliza Mardian, assessed that the MBG program has the potential to increase pressure on food prices during Ramadan if it is not accompanied by careful planning.\n\n\"Even without MBG, the price of chicken and egg meat has increased due to the increase in aggregate demand, while the supply side is limited because there is a production period,\" said Eliza to Bisnis, Friday (13/2/2026).\n\nEliza assessed that the massive kitchen operations of the Nutrition Fulfillment Service Unit (SPPG) encouraged distributors to prioritize supplies to SPPG rather than traditional markets.\n\nAccording to him, distributors tend to channel supplies to SPPG because the payment scheme is cash and fast, different from traditional market traders who generally use a temporary payment system. This condition has the potential to make supply in the market more limited.\n\nLooking ahead, Core Indonesia estimates that pressure on chicken egg prices will continue in early 2026, in line with the government's plan to increase the number of SPPGs and the momentum of Ramadan which falls earlier in February-March 2026.",

Permintaan naik turun, harga menjadi naik turun,” kata Budi saat ditemui di Kantor Kemendag, Jakarta, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nMenurut Budi, dengan adanya MBG, permintaan menjadi lebih pasti sehingga produsen dapat menyesuaikan produksi secara linear mengikuti kebutuhan. Kondisi tersebut, lanjutnya, justru membuat harga cenderung stabil dan tidak bergejolak.\n\nLebih lanjut, Budi juga menepis MBG memicu lonjakanharga pangandi pasar.

Kondisi tersebut berpotensi membuat pasokan di pasar menjadi lebih terbatas.\n\nKe depan, Core Indonesia memperkirakan tekanan harga telur ayam masih berlanjut pada awal 2026, seiring rencana pemerintah menambah jumlah SPPG serta momentum Ramadan yang jatuh lebih awal pada Februari—Maret 2026.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Minister of Finance Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa has increased the budget allocation worth IDR 10.65 trillion for post-flood management in Aceh and Sumatra.\n\nPurbaya initially revealed that there was a proposal for a large additional spending budget from various ministries/institutions (K/L) for the rehabilitation and disaster resilience phase.\n\nOne of the biggest proposals came from the Ministry of Public Works (PU) with an estimate of IDR 70 trillion drawn in a multi-year scheme. The allocation is planned at IDR 28 trillion this year, IDR 28 trillion next year, and IDR 16 trillion the following year.\n\nFurthermore, the Ministry of Finance noted that the combined K/L proposals that have been submitted currently reach a figure of around IDR 43 trillion. These funds include disaster resilience support programs, land rehabilitation and irrigation, seed assistance, and animal feed.\n\nTo prevent budget overlaps, Purbaya explained that all of these proposals must go through a synchronization stage at the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas).\n\n\"After approval, it will be sent to the Disaster Task Force led by the Minister of Home Affairs. Later it will be sent to us [Kemenkeu], and we will distribute it according to what was proposed. Basically the budget is different from the previous BNPB,\" explained Purbaya in the DPR, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nAlso Read\n\nTask Force Operational Costs and Additional TKD Regarding operational costs in the field, Purbaya ensures that operational funding for the Disaster Task Force Team will not interfere with physical handling funds. This budget has been proposed separately by the Minister of Home Affairs.\n\n\"The Ministry of Home Affairs has submitted a proposal for the Task Force's operational budget of IDR 400 billion along with the details,\" he said.\n\nBased on this proposal, the Ministry of Finance has directed that operational funding be realized through a special use scheme on the Ministry of Home Affairs' Budget Implementation List (DIPA).\n\nFurthermore, Purbaya also revealed that the Ministry of Finance had also increased the TKD allocation by IDR 10.65 trillion. According to him, these additions include settlement of underpayments from profit sharing funds (DBH), additional DBH, additional general allocation funds (DAU), and special autonomy funds for Aceh.\n\nPreviously, Purbaya said that there were three directions for budget distribution prepared. First, including allocations through the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB)\n\nSecond, funds managed through the Disaster Task Force Team. Third, the Transfer to Regions (TKD) scheme through a mechanism for adding and accelerating disbursement.\n\nFor starters, Purbaya revealed that he had injected additional ready-to-use funds into BNPB beyond the regular ceiling this year.\n\n\"The BNPB ceiling for the 2026 fiscal year is IDR 490 billion, which includes ready-to-use funds for emergency disaster management amounting to IDR 250 billion. But the government has added ready-to-use funds to BNPB amounting to IDR 4.63 trillion which were disbursed on February 6,\" he said in a meeting with the DPR, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nThe state treasurer detailed that of the total injection of fresh funds, the largest portion, namely IDR 4.35 trillion, was devoted to emergency disaster management in Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra.\n\nMeanwhile, the remaining IDR 0.27 trillion was allocated for other regions. Purbaya also stated his commitment to increase the budget again if funds at BNPB were insufficient.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Menteri Keuangan Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa menambah alokasi anggaran senilai Rp10,65 triliun untuk penanganan pasca banjir di Aceh dan Sumatra.\n\nPurbaya awalnya mengungkap adanya usulan anggaran belanja tambahan bernilai jumbo dari berbagai kementerian/lembaga (K/L) untuk fase rehabilitasi dan ketahanan bencana.\n\nSalah satu usulan terbesar datang dari Kementerian Pekerjaan Umum (PU) dengan estimasi mencapai Rp70 triliun yang ditarik dalam skema tahun jamak. Alokasinya direncanakan sebesar Rp28 triliun pada tahun ini, Rp28 triliun pada tahun depan, dan Rp16 triliun pada tahun berikutnya.\n\nLebih lanjut, Kemenkeu mencatat usulan gabungan K/L yang telah masuk saat ini menyentuh angka sekitar Rp43 triliun. Dana ini mencakup program dukungan ketahanan bencana, rehabilitasi lahan dan irigasi, bantuan benih, hingga pakan ternak.\n\nUntuk mencegah tumpang tindih anggaran, Purbaya menjelaskan seluruh usulan ini harus melalui tahapan sinkronisasi di Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional (Bappenas).\n\n\"Setelah disetujui, baru dikirim ke Satgas Bencana yang dipimpin oleh Mendagri. Nanti baru ke kami [Kemenkeu], dan kami salurkan sesuai dengan yang diusulkan.

Anggaran ini telah diusulkan secara terpisah oleh Menteri Dalam Negeri.\n\n\"Kementerian Dalam Negeri telah menyampaikan usulan anggaran operasional Satgas sebesar Rp400 miliar beserta perinciannya,\" ungkapnya.\n\nAtas usulan tersebut, Kementerian Keuangan telah mengarahkan agar pendanaan operasional direalisasikan melalui skema penggunaan khusus pada Daftar Isian Pelaksanaan Anggaran (DIPA) Kementerian Dalam Negeri.\n\nLebih lanjut, Purbaya juga mengungkapkan Kementerian Keuangan juga telah menambah alokasi TKD sebesar Rp10,65 triliun. Menurutnya, tambahan tersebut termasuk penyelesaian kurang bayar dana bagi hasil (DBH), DBH tambahan, dana alokasi umum (DAU) tambahan, dan dana otonomi khusus untuk Aceh.\n\nSebelumnya, Purbaya menuturkan bahwa terdapat tiga arah penyaluran anggaran yang disiapkan.Pertama, mencakup alokasi melalui Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana (BNPB)\n\nKedua, dana yang dikelola melalui Tim Satuan Tugas (Satgas) Bencana.Ketiga, skema Transfer ke Daerah (TKD) lewat mekanisme penambahan dan percepatan pencairan.\n\nSebagai permulaan, Purbaya mengungkapkan telah menyuntikkan tambahan dana siap pakai kepada BNPB di luar pagu reguler tahun ini.\n\n\"Pagu BNPB tahun anggaran 2026 itu sebesar Rp490 miliar, di dalamnya termasuk dana siap pakai untuk penanganan darurat bencana sebesar Rp250 miliar. Tapi pemerintah telah menambah dana siap pakai pada BNPB sebesar Rp4,63 triliun yang telah cair tanggal 6 Februari kemarin,\" ujarnya dalam rapat dengan DPR, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nBendahara negara merincikan, dari total suntikan dana segar tersebut, porsi terbesar yakni Rp4,35 triliun dikhususkan untuk penanganan darurat bencana di Aceh, Sumut, dan Sumbar.\n\nSementara itu, sisa Rp0,27 triliun dialokasikan untuk wilayah lainnya. Purbaya juga menyatakan komitmen untuk kembali menambah anggaran apabila dana di BNPB belum mencukupi.",

Kanlegal is scrubbing now,\" he said.\n\nPreviously, President Prabowo Subianto left for Washington DC with the agenda of a bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump on Monday (16/2/2026).\n\nAlso Read\n\nDuring his visit to Uncle Sam's country, the Indonesian Head of State was accompanied by the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Bahlil Lahadalia and Cabinet Secretary Teddy Indra Wijaya.\n\nPresident Prabowo is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump to discuss strengthening relations between Indonesia and the US, as well as strategic cooperation in various economic fields with several negotiations and trade agreements.\n\n\"This visit is part of President Prabowo's active direct diplomatic steps to improve the economic chain and domestic industrial productivity,\" wrote the Cabinet Secretariat's official Instagram account, @sekretariat.kabinet.\n\nMeanwhile, Paramadina University Economist Wijayanto Samirin said that US tariff policy has the potential to suppress the competitiveness of domestic industry, especially labor-intensive sectors which have been the backbone of exports and employment.\n\n\"Labor-intensive sectors that have the potential to be eroded by products from other countries, including textiles and textile products, shoes, rubber and rubber products, furniture and electronic products,\" said Wijayanto to Bisnis, Monday (16/2/2026).\n\nAccording to him, a number of these sectors need to be a priority for government protection in the trade negotiation process with the US, considering increasingly tight global competition, especially from low-cost exporting countries.\n\nWijayanto said that the government needs to capitalize on Indonesia's strategic position in the region so that Indonesia's bargaining position is superior in facing US tariff policies. One of them is through Indonesia's role in the Board of Peace to strengthen the structural reform agenda in the country.\n\nContacted separately, the Executive Director of the Center of Reform on Economics (Core) Indonesia, Mohammad Faisal, assessed that the direction of trade renegotiations carried out by the US government was to seek full access to Indonesia's critical minerals as well as providing a reciprocal tariff dispensation of 19% for a number of commodities.\n\n\"If we just look at it in general, if what is given to facilitate tariffs is raw material commodities then it is clear that this does not support the industry. Because it means that what is encouraged to be exported is the raw material, not processed products,\" said Faisal to Bisnis.\n\nAccording to Faisal, if tariff facilities are only provided for raw material commodities, such as coffee and cocoa, then this policy will not support domestic industrial development.\n\nLikewise with requests for full access to critical minerals. He believes that if this access only results in the export of raw mining materials, then the benefits will have minimal impact on national industrialization.\n\nApart from that, Faisal also highlighted the difference in approach with China which chose to invest in developing the processing industry in Indonesia. Even though the processing level is still at an early stage and has not yet produced downstream products of high added value, this step has at least encouraged industrial growth and increased added value in the country. .\n\nHe assessed that a number of points in negotiations with the US had the potential to conflict with President Prabowo's expectations of encouraging industrialization and downstreaming if not negotiated properly.\n\nFor this reason, according to him, the Indonesian negotiating team needs to understand this context and be able to translate it into a technical strategy supported by diplomatic strength.\n\n\"Because if not, then we will be in vain, meaning that the negotiations are not in line with the Prabowo government's expectations to encourage industrialization, including in this context downstreaming,\" he concluded.",

Saat ini, prosesnya telah memasuki tahap akhir berupalegal scrubbinguntuk memastikan kesesuaian dan aspek hukum sebelum diumumkan secara resmi.\n\n“Kan sudah selesai, substansinya sudah selesai. Kanlegal scrubbingsekarang,” ujarnya.\n\nSebelumnya, Presiden Prabowo Subianto bertolak ke Washington DC dengan agenda pertemuan bilateral dengan Presiden AS Donald Trump pada Senin (16/2/2026).\n\nBaca Juga\n\nDalam kunjungan ke Negara Paman Sam, Kepala Negara RI didampingi oleh Menteri Energi Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) Bahlil Lahadalia serta Sekretaris Kabinet Teddy Indra Wijaya.\n\nPresiden Prabowo diagendakan melakukan pertemuan bilateral dengan Presiden AS Donald Trump untuk membahas penguatan hubungan Indonesia dan AS, serta kerja sama strategis di berbagai bidang ekonomi dengan adanya beberapa perundingan serta perjanjian dagang.\n\n“Kunjungan ini menjadi bagian dari langkah aktif diplomasi langsung Presiden Prabowo untuk meningkatkan rantai ekonomi serta produktivitas industri dalam negeri,” tulis akun Instagram resmi Sekretariat Kabinet, @sekretariat.kabinet.\n\nSementara itu, Ekonom Universitas Paramadina Wijayanto Samirin mengatakan kebijakan tarif AS berpotensi menekan daya saing industri dalam negeri, khususnya sektor-sektor padat karya yang selama ini menjadi tulang punggung ekspor dan penyerapan tenaga kerja.\n\n“Sektor padat karya yang berpotensi tergerus oleh produk dari negara lain, termasuk tekstil dan produk tekstil, sepatu, karet dan produk karet, furniture serta produk elektronik,” kata Wijayanto kepadaBisnis, Senin (16/2/2026).\n\nMenurutnya, sejumlah sektor tersebut perlu menjadi prioritas perlindungan pemerintah dalam proses negosiasi dagang dengan AS, mengingat persaingan global yang semakin ketat, terutama dari negara-negara eksportir berbiaya rendah.\n\nWijayanto menyebut, pemerintah perlu mengkapitalisasi posisi strategis Indonesia di kawasan agar posisi tawar Indonesia lebih unggul dalam menghadapi kebijakan tarif AS. Salah satunya melalui peran Indonesia dalamBoard of Peacehingga memperkuat agenda reformasi struktural di dalam negeri.\n\nDihubungi terpisah, Direktur Eksekutif Center of Reform on Economics (Core) Indonesia Mohammad Faisal menilai arah renegosiasi perdagangan yang dilakukan pemerintah AS menginginkan akses penuh terhadapcritical mineralsIndonesia serta memberikan dispensasi tarif resiprokal sebesar 19% bagi sejumlah komoditas.\n\n“Kalau kita hanya melihat dari secara umum, kalau yang diberikan kemudahan tarif itu adalah komoditas bahan mentah maka jelas itu tidak mendukung industri. Karena berarti yang didorong untuk diekspor itu adalah bahan mentahnya, bukan produk olahan,” kata Faisal kepadaBisnis.\n\nMenurut Faisal, jika kemudahan tarif hanya diberikan pada komoditas bahan mentah, seperti kopi hingga kakao, maka kebijakan tersebut tidak mendukung pembangunan industri dalam negeri.\n\nBegitu pula pada permintaan akses penuhcritical minerals. Dia menilai jika akses tersebut hanya berujung pada ekspor bahan tambang mentah, maka manfaatnya berdampak minim bagi industrialisasi nasional.\n\nDi samping itu, Faisal juga menyoroti perbedaan pendekatan dengan China yang memilih berinvestasi pada pembangunan industri pengolahan di Indonesia. Meski tingkat pengolahannya masih pada tahap awal dan belum menghasilkan produk hilir bernilai tambah tinggi, langkah tersebut setidaknya telah mendorong tumbuhnya industri serta meningkatkan nilai tambah di dalam negeri.\n\nDia menilai sejumlah poin dalam negosiasi dengan AS berpotensi bertentangan dengan ekspektasi Presiden Prabowo untuk mendorong industrialisasi dan hilirisasi jika tidak dinegosiasikan dengan tepat.\n\nUntuk itu, menurutnya, tim negosiasi Indonesia perlu memahami konteks tersebut dan mampu menerjemahkannya ke dalam strategi teknis yang didukung oleh kekuatan diplomasi.\n\n“Karena kalau tidak, ya sia-sia kita berarti perundingannya ini tidak sejalan dengan ekspektasi pemerintah Prabowo untuk mendorong industrialisasi, termasuk dalam konteks ini adalah hilirisasi,” pungkasnya.",

According to him, there is an increase in food prices in one market, but in other markets food prices are actually below the national average.\n\nFor the Oliviaita people's cooking oil commodity, Budi admitted that there was a slight increase in several areas. Currently, the average price of Minyakita is recorded at IDR 16,020 per liter. However, it is still lower than the previous average which reached IDR 16,800 per liter.\n\nAlso Read\n\nAccording to him, the policy of the Minister of Trade Regulation which requires 35% of BUMN food supplies to be distributed directly to consumers is starting to show an impact on reducing prices.\n\n\"So hopefully during Ramadan prices will be under control, supply will be sufficient, and we will continue to monitor,\" he said.\n\nFor the price of purebred chicken meat, continued Budi, the average is at IDR 40,259 per kilogram or exceeding the reference sales price (HAP) of IDR 40,000 per kilogram.\n\nThen, purebred chicken eggs also experienced a slight increase. The national average price for chicken eggs was recorded at IDR 30,750 per kilogram, slightly higher than the HAP which was set at IDR 30,000 per kilogram.\n\nOn the other hand, Budi said that the prices of other food commodities were still below the reference limit. For beef prices, for example, the national average was recorded at IDR 133,618 per kilogram, still below the HAP of IDR 140,000.\n\nLikewise, the price of garlic is in the range of IDR 36,875 per kilogram, lower than the HAP which is set at IDR 38,000 per kilogram.\n\nFurthermore, Budi stated that his party had gathered suppliers and would hold another follow-up meeting in the near future. From the results of temporary coordination, business actors said that supply was still safe.\n\n\"They [business actors] said that all supplies were available, there were no problems,\" he said.\n\nApart from that, the Ministry of Trade also pays special attention to distribution aspects, especially in markets with relatively high prices. This coordination was carried out with the National Food Agency (Bapanas), the Ministry of Agriculture (Kementan), regional governments, the National Police, and the Food Task Force (Satgas).\n\n\"We monitor it so that prices don't rise.

Menurutnya, ada kenaikan harga pangan di suatu pasar, tetapi di pasar lain harga pangan justru berada di bawah rata-rata nasional.\n\nUntuk komoditas minyak goreng rakyat Minyakita, Budi mengakui terdapat kenaikan tipis di beberapa wilayah. Saat ini, harga rata-rata Minyakita tercatat di level Rp16.020 per liter. Namun, masih lebih rendah dibandingkan rata-rata sebelumnya yang sempat mencapai Rp16.800 per liter.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nMenurutnya, kebijakan Peraturan Menteri Perdagangan yang mewajibkan 35% pasokan BUMN pangan disalurkan langsung ke konsumen mulai menunjukkan dampak terhadap penurunan harga.\n\n“Jadi mudah-mudahan selama Ramadan ini harga terkendali, pasokan cukup, dan kami terus melakukan monitor,” tuturnya.\n\nUntuk harga daging ayam ras, lanjut Budi, rata-ratanya berada di level Rp40.259 per kilogram atau melampaui harga acuan penjualan (HAP) Rp40.000 per kilogram.\n\nKemudian, telur ayam ras juga mengalami kenaikan tipis. Harga rata-rata nasional telur ayam tercatat sebesar Rp30.750 per kilogram, sedikit lebih tinggi dari HAP yang ditetapkan sebesar Rp30.000 per kilogram.\n\nDi sisi lain, Budi menuturkan harga komoditas pangan lain masih berada di bawah batas acuan.

Dari hasil koordinasi sementara, pelaku usaha menyampaikan bahwa pasokan masih aman.\n\n“Mereka [pelaku usaha] menyampaikan pasokan semua ada, tidak ada masalah,” ujarnya.\n\nSelain itu, Kemendag juga memberi perhatian khusus pada aspek distribusi, terutama di pasar-pasar dengan harga relatif tinggi. Koordinasi tersebut dilakukan bersama Badan Pangan Nasional (Bapanas), Kementerian Pertanian (Kementan), pemerintah daerah, Polri, hingga Satuan Tugas (Satgas) Pangan.\n\n“Kita monitor supaya tidak ada harga-harga yang naik.

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — The Ministry of Finance is preparing a funding scheme for emergency management and rehabilitation of natural disasters in the regions of Aceh, North Sumatra (North Sumatra), and West Sumatra (Sumbar).\n\nMinister of Finance Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa explained that there are three directions for budget distribution being prepared. First, includes allocations through the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB)\n\nSecond, funds managed through the Disaster Task Force Team. Third, the Transfer to Regions (TKD) scheme through a mechanism for adding and accelerating disbursement.\n\nFor starters, Purbaya revealed that he had injected additional ready-to-use funds into BNPB beyond the regular ceiling this year.\n\n\"The BNPB ceiling for the 2026 fiscal year is IDR 490 billion, which includes ready-to-use funds for emergency disaster management amounting to IDR 250 billion. But the government has added ready-to-use funds to BNPB amounting to IDR 4.63 trillion which were disbursed on February 6,\" he said in a meeting with the DPR, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nThe state treasurer detailed that of the total injection of fresh funds, the largest portion, namely IDR 4.35 trillion, was devoted to emergency disaster management in Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra.\n\nAlso Read\n\nMeanwhile, the remaining IDR 0.27 trillion was allocated for other regions. Purbaya also stated his commitment to increase the budget again if funds at BNPB were insufficient.\n\nOutside of the BNPB emergency response phase, Purbaya revealed that there were proposals for additional spending budgets worth a large amount from various ministries/institutions (K/L) for the rehabilitation and disaster resilience phase.\n\nOne of the biggest proposals came from the Ministry of Public Works (PU) with an estimate of IDR 70 trillion drawn in a multi-year scheme. The allocation is planned at IDR 28 trillion this year, IDR 28 trillion next year, and IDR 16 trillion the following year.\n\nFurthermore, the Ministry of Finance noted that the combined K/L proposals that have been submitted currently reach a figure of around IDR 43 trillion. These funds include disaster resilience support programs, land rehabilitation and irrigation, seed assistance, and animal feed.\n\nTo prevent budget overlaps, Purbaya explained that all of these proposals must go through a synchronization stage at the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas).\n\n\"After approval, it will be sent to the Disaster Task Force led by the Minister of Home Affairs. Later it will come to us [Kemenkeu], and we will distribute it according to what was proposed. Basically the budget is different from the previous BNPB,\" explained Purbaya.\n\nRegarding operational costs in the field, Purbaya ensured that operational funding for the Disaster Task Force Team would not interfere with physical handling funds. This budget has been proposed separately by the Minister of Home Affairs.\n\n\"The Ministry of Home Affairs has submitted a proposal for the Task Force's operational budget of IDR 400 billion along with the details,\" he said.\n\nBased on this proposal, the Ministry of Finance has directed that operational funding be realized through a special use scheme on the Ministry of Home Affairs' Budget Implementation List (DIPA).\n\nFurthermore, Purbaya also revealed that the Ministry of Finance had also increased the TKD allocation by IDR 10.65 trillion. According to him, these additions include settlement of underpayments from profit sharing funds (DBH), additional DBH, additional general allocation funds (DAU), and special autonomy funds for Aceh.",

Tapi pemerintah telah menambah dana siap pakai pada BNPB sebesar Rp4,63 triliun yang telah cair tanggal 6 Februari kemarin,\" ujarnya dalam rapat dengan DPR, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nBendahara negara merincikan, dari total suntikan dana segar tersebut, porsi terbesar yakni Rp4,35 triliun dikhususkan untuk penanganan darurat bencana di Aceh, Sumut, dan Sumbar.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nSementara itu, sisa Rp0,27 triliun dialokasikan untuk wilayah lainnya. Purbaya juga menyatakan komitmen untuk kembali menambah anggaran apabila dana di BNPB belum mencukupi.\n\nDi luar fase tanggap darurat BNPB, Purbaya mengungkapkan adanya usulan anggaran belanja tambahan bernilai jumbo dari berbagai kementerian/lembaga (K/L) untuk fase rehabilitasi dan ketahanan bencana.\n\nSalah satu usulan terbesar datang dari Kementerian Pekerjaan Umum (PU) dengan estimasi mencapai Rp70 triliun yang ditarik dalam skema tahun jamak. Alokasinya direncanakan sebesar Rp28 triliun pada tahun ini, Rp28 triliun pada tahun depan, dan Rp16 triliun pada tahun berikutnya.\n\nLebih lanjut, Kemenkeu mencatat usulan gabungan K/L yang telah masuk saat ini menyentuh angka sekitar Rp43 triliun. Dana ini mencakup program dukungan ketahanan bencana, rehabilitasi lahan dan irigasi, bantuan benih, hingga pakan ternak.\n\nUntuk mencegah tumpang tindih anggaran, Purbaya menjelaskan seluruh usulan ini harus melalui tahapan sinkronisasi di Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional (Bappenas).\n\n\"Setelah disetujui, baru dikirim ke Satgas Bencana yang dipimpin oleh Mendagri. Nanti baru ke kami [Kemenkeu], dan kami salurkan sesuai dengan yang diusulkan. Pada dasarnya anggarannyan berbeda dengan BNPB yang tadi,\" jelas Purbaya.\n\nTerkait dengan biaya operasional di lapangan, Purbaya memastikan pendanaan operasional Tim Satgas Bencana tidak akan mengganggu dana penanganan fisik. Anggaran ini telah diusulkan secara terpisah oleh Menteri Dalam Negeri.\n\n\"Kementerian Dalam Negeri telah menyampaikan usulan anggaran operasional Satgas sebesar Rp400 miliar beserta perinciannya,\" ungkapnya.\n\nAtas usulan tersebut, Kementerian Keuangan telah mengarahkan agar pendanaan operasional direalisasikan melalui skema penggunaan khusus pada Daftar Isian Pelaksanaan Anggaran (DIPA) Kementerian Dalam Negeri.\n\nLebih lanjut, Purbaya juga mengungkapkan Kementerian Keuangan juga telah menambah alokasi TKD sebesar Rp10,65 triliun. Menurutnya, tambahan tersebut termasuk penyelesaian kurang bayar dana bagi hasil (DBH), DBH tambahan, dana alokasi umum (DAU) tambahan, dan dana otonomi khusus untuk Aceh.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — The Directorate General of Taxes, Ministry of Finance (DJP Kemenkeu) has received 2.9 million notification letter reports, aka annual SPTs for 2025 income tax (PPh) up to 18 February 2026.\n\nDirector of Service Extension and Public Relations at the Ministry of Finance, Inge Diana Rismawanti, detailed that for the January - December financial year, the maximum SPT for personal income tax (OP) for employees was 2.55 million SPT.\n\nThen, 270,960 SPTs from non-employee OPs as well as 82,229 corporate SPTs denominated in rupiah and 92 corporate SPTs denominated in US dollars.\n\nAs for those with different financial years, or reported starting August 1 2025, the amount received is 594 SPTs from taxpayers denominated in rupiah, and 16 corporate taxpayer tax returns denominated in US dollars.\n\nOn the other hand, the progress of Coretax account activation has reached 13.9 million accounts, including 12.9 million OP accounts, 892,396 corporate taxpayers, 89,503 government agency taxpayers, and 225 trading company taxpayers via electronic systems.\n\nPreviously, Minister of Finance Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa said that improving the Coretax system was one way to achieve this year's tax revenue target of IDR 2,357.7 trillion.\n\nAlso Read\n\nMinister of Finance (Menkeu) Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa estimates that 2026 tax revenues could exceed the target set in the APBN, namely IDR 2,357.7 trillion. This is estimated by him despite the low base of growth in tax revenues last year which also became the focus of foreign rating agencies.\n\nFor your information, the government has set a tax revenue target this year of IDR 2,357.7 trillion or growth of 7.69% (YoY) from the 2025 APBN target of IDR 2,189.3 trillion.\n\nThe problem is, the realization of tax revenue last year was only IDR 1,917.6 trillion, resulting in a shortfall of IDR 271.7 trillion. This means that the growth base from last year's realization to achieve this year's target is higher, namely 22.9% (YoY). In other words, the government must pursue additional deposits of IDR 440.1 trillion to achieve the 2026 target from realization until the end of last year.\n\nHowever, it seems that Minister of Finance Purbaya remains optimistic. He even estimates that this year he will be able to collect tax revenues to exceed the target. This optimism emerged after the realization of tax revenues in January 2026 jumped 30.8% (YoY).\n\nPurbaya conveyed this at a joint meeting with Commission XI DPR which discussed state revenues, Wednesday (4/2/2026). He reported that the realization of tax revenues in January 2026 amounted to IDR 116.2 trillion or grew 30.8% (YoY) compared to January 2025, namely IDR 88.9 trillion.\n\nPurbaya explained that the double digit growth in tax revenues in early 2026 was driven by gross revenues of 7% (YoY) and a decrease in tax returns (restitution) of minus 23%. Thus, he explained, all types of taxes recorded net positive growth.\n\n\"The picture of tax revenues this January shows that it seems that a reversal in economic direction is indeed taking place so that tax revenues have grown from last year,\" he explained, quoted again on Sunday (8/2/2026).\n\nFrom the double digit annual growth in the first month of 2026, Purbaya sees the possibility that the 2026 tax revenue target of IDR 2,357.7 trillion could even be exceeded. However, of course if it is considered without changes in future conditions (ceteris paribus).\n\n\"Let's assume the same, we can maintain that growth. At the end of the year [2026] we can get tax income of IDR 2,492 trillion. This is already above the figure of IDR 2,357 trillion in the 2026 APBN. This is an overly exaggerated example, but at least we already see that it is possible,\" he said to members of the DPR Finance Commission.\n\nThe former Chairman of the Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS) explained that there were various improvements he wanted to make. An example is the matter of restitution or tax refund.\n\nIn 2025, tax refunds will jump to IDR 361 trillion. Purbaya said the increase was almost IDR 100 trillion compared to 2024.\n\nEfforts to improve too a is carried out in the core tax administration system, namely Coretax, as well as internally from the Directorate General of Taxes (DJP). After the previous week reshuffled 31 officials at the Directorate General of Customs and Excise (DJBC), Purbaya rotated the positions of 40 DJP echelon II officials, Friday (6/2/2026).",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Direktorat Jenderal Pajak Kementerian Keuangan (DJP Kemenkeu) telah menerima sebanyak 2,9 juta laporan surat pemberitahuan alias SPT tahunan pajak penghasilan (PPh) 2025 sampai dengan 18 Februari 2026.\n\nDirektur Penyuluhan Pelayanan dan Hubungan Masyarakat DJP Kemenkeu Inge Diana Rismawanti merinci untuk Tahun Buku Januari - Desember, SPT untuk PPh orang pribadi (OP) karyawan paling banyak yakni 2,55 juta SPT.\n\nKemudian, 270.960 SPT dari OP nonkaryawan serta 82.229 SPT badan berdenominasi rupiah dan 92 SPT badan berdenominasi dolar AS.\n\nAdapun untuk yang beda tahun buku, atau dilaporkan mulai 1 Agustus 2025, jumlah yang diterima yakni 594 SPT dari WP berdenominasi rupiah, dan 16 SPT WP badan berdenominasi dolar AS.\n\nDi sisi lain, progres aktivasi akun Coretax telah mencapai 13,9 juta akun yang meliputi WP OP 12,9 juta akun, 892.396 WP badan, 89.503 WP instansi pemerintah, serta 225 WP perusahaan perdagangan melalui sistem elektronik.\n\nSebelumnya Menteri Keuangan Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa menyebut pembenahan sistem Coretax menjadi salah satu caranya untuk mengejar target penerimaan pajak tahun ini sebesar Rp2.357,7 triliun.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nMenteri Keuangan (Menkeu)Purbaya Yudhi Sadewamemperkirakanpenerimaan pajak2026 bisa melampaui target yang ditetapkan pada APBN yakni Rp2.357,7 triliun. Hal ini diperkirakan olehnya kendati basis pertumbuhan penerimaan pajak tahun lalu yang rendah sehingga turut menjadi sorotan lembaga pemeringkat asing.\n\nUntuk diketahui, pemerintah memasang target penerimaan pajak tahun ini sebesar Rp2.357,7 triliun atau tumbuh 7,69% (YoY) dari target APBN 2025 yakni Rp2.189,3 triliun.\n\nMasalahnya, realisasi penerimaan pajak tahun lalu hanya Rp1.917,6 triliun sehingga terjadishortfallsebesar Rp271,7 triliun. Artinya, basis pertumbuhan dari realisasi tahun lalu untuk mengejar target tahun ini menjadi lebih tinggi yakni 22,9% (YoY). Dengan kata lain, pemerintah harus mengejar tambahan setoran Rp440,1 triliun untuk mencapai target 2026 dari realisasi sampai akhir tahun lalu.\n\nNamun demikian, tampaknya Menkeu Purbaya tetap optimistis. Dia bahkan memperkirakan tahun ini bisa mengumpulkan penerimaan pajak hingga melampaui target. Optimisme itu muncul usai realisasi penerimaan pajak Januari 2026 melonjak 30,8% (YoY).\n\nHal itu disampaikan Purbaya pada rapat bersama Komisi XI DPR yang membahas penerimaan negara, Rabu (4/2/2026). Dia melaporkan bahwa realisasi penerimaan pajak pada Januari 2026 sebesar Rp116,2 triliun atau tumbuh 30,8% (YoY) dibandingkan Januari 2025 yaitu Rp88,9 triliun.\n\nPurbaya memaparkan bahwa pertumbuhan double digit penerimaan pajak awal 2026 itu didorong oleh penerimaan bruto sebesar 7% (YoY) dan penurunan pengembalian pajak (restitusi) sebesar minus 23%. Dengan demikian, terangnya, seluruh jenis pajak mencatat pertumbuhan positif secara neto.\n\n\"Gambaran penerimaan pajak Januari ini menunjukkan bahwa kelihatannya betul-betul memang pembalikan arah ekonomi sedang terjadi sehingga pendapatan pajaknya tumbuh dari tahun lalu,\" terangnya, dikutip kembali Minggu (8/2/2026).\n\nDari pertumbuhan tahunandouble digitpada satu bulan pertama 2026, Purbaya melihat ada kemungkinan target penerimaan pajak 2026 Rp2.357,7 triliun bahkan bisa terlampaui. Namun, tentunya apabila dipertimbangkan tanpa perubahan kondisi ke depan (ceteris paribus).\n\n\"Let'skita asumsikan sama, kami bisa jaga pertumbuhan itu. Akhir tahun [2026] kami bisa dapat pajakincomeRp2.492 triliun. Ini sudah di atas angka Rp2.357 triliun di APBN 2026. Ini kan permisalan yang terlalu berlebihan, tetapi paling enggak kami udah kelihatan lah seperti itu ada kemungkinannya,\" katanya kepada anggota Komisi Keuangan DPR.\n\nMantan Ketua Lembaga Penjamin Simpanan (LPS) itu memaparkan terdapat berbagai upaya pembenahan yang ingin dilakukan olehnya. Contohnya yakni soal restitusi atau pengembalian pajak.\n\nPada 2025, restitusi pajak melonjak ke Rp361 triliun. Purbaya menyebut kenaikannya hampir Rp100 triliun dibandingkan 2024.\n\nUpaya pembenahan juga dilakukan pada sistem inti administrasi perpajakan, yakni Coretax, maupun dari internal Direktorat Jenderal Pajak (DJP). Usai pekan sebelumnya merombak 31 pejabat di Direktorat Jenderal Bea dan Cukai (DJBC), Purbaya melakukan rotasi jabatan pada 40 pejabat eselon II DJP, Jumat (6/2/2026).",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — The Ministry of Trade (Kemendag) admits that the high price of crude palm oil (CPO) is one of the factors that is putting pressure on the cooking oil supply chain, including Minyakita.\n\nMinister of Trade (Mendag) Budi Santoso said that CPO prices are currently at a higher level compared to the conditions three years ago when the highest retail price (HET) policy was established.\n\nEven though last year the price of CPO experienced a decline of around 15%–16%, on average the price of CPO is now recorded at IDR 14,035 per kilogram, exceeding the distribution price from producers to first level distributors (D1) which is around IDR 13,500 per kilogram.\n\n\"Now the CPO price for oil raw materials yesterday in Palembang was IDR 14,035, CPO,\" said Budi when met at the Ministry of Trade Office, Jakarta, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nFor this reason, the government will increase the number of second brand cooking oils as a companion to Minyakita so that people have more choices of products at affordable prices.\n\nHowever, Budi ensured that the CPO price did not affect the price of Minyakita at the producer level. He ensured that the government continues to coordinate with producers so that the selling price of Minyakita from producers to D1 remains in accordance with the HET.\n\nAlso Read\n\n\"We continue to coordinate with them [manufacturers], because sales must remain in accordance with the HET,\" he said.\n\nBudi said that currently the average price of Minyakita is at IDR 16,020 per liter or still exceeding the highest retail price (HET) of IDR 15,700 per liter. He explained that this condition occurred because the supply fulfillment process was still ongoing at the State-Owned Food Enterprise (BUMN) level.\n\nCurrently, the realization of the distribution of Oilita from producers to BUMN has approached 30% of the minimum target of 35%. Even though supplies are starting to become available, distribution to all regions of Indonesia takes time, so prices at the consumer level have not yet fully returned to HET.\n\n\"Well, they also have to distribute it, distributing it throughout the archipelago may also take time,\" he explained.\n\nPreviously, the Ministry of Trade noted an increase in the Reference Price (HR) for crude palm oil (CPO) commodities ahead of the Chinese New Year and Ramadan 2026 celebrations.\n\nDirector General of Foreign Trade at the Ministry of Trade, Tommy Andana, said that HR CPO for the period 1-28 February 2026 was set at US$918.47 per metric ton (MT). This figure increased by US$2.84 or around 0.31% compared to HR January 2026 which was at the level of US$915.64/MT.\n\nAccording to Tommy, the increase in CPO HR was triggered by increasing demand amidst a decline in production.\n\n\"This increase was caused by increased demand in anticipation of the Chinese New Year and Ramadan, which was not accompanied by an increase in supply due to a decrease in production,\" said Tommy in a written statement, Friday (30/1/2026).\n\nThe determination of HR CPO refers to the average price from a number of exchanges, namely the Indonesian CPO Exchange at US$855.66/MT, the Malaysian CPO Exchange at US$981.28/MT, and the CPO price at the Port of Rotterdam which reached US$1,209.81/MT.\n\nFrom these three sources, the final calculation uses the average of the two median prices to produce HR CPO of US$918.47/MT.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has set the CPO Export Duty (BK) for February 2026 to remain at US$74 per MT. The Export Levy (PE) is set at 10% of HR CPO or US$91.8472 per MT.",

Dia menjelaskan, kondisi tersebut terjadi karena proses pemenuhan pasokan masih berjalan di tingkat Badan Usaha Milik Negara (BUMN) Pangan.\n\nAdapun saat ini, realisasi penyaluran Minyakita dari produsen ke BUMN telah mendekati 30% dari target minimal 35%. Meski pasokan mulai tersedia, distribusi ke seluruh wilayah Indonesia membutuhkan waktu, sehingga harga di tingkat konsumen belum sepenuhnya kembali ke HET.\n\n“Nah cuman kan mereka juga harus mendistribusikan, mendistribusikan ke seluruh nusantara mungkin juga butuh waktu,” terangnya.\n\nSebelumnya, Kemendag mencatat adanya kenaikan Harga Referensi (HR) untuk komoditas minyak kelapa sawit mentah (crude palm oil/CPO) menjelang perayaan Hari Raya Imlek serta Ramadan 2026.\n\nDirektur Jenderal Perdagangan Luar Negeri Kemendag Tommy Andanamengatakan HR CPO periode 1—28 Februari 2026 ditetapkan sebesar US$918,47 per metrik ton (MT). Angka tersebut meningkat sebesar US$2,84 atau sekitar 0,31% dibandingkan HR Januari 2026 yang berada di level US$915,64/MT.\n\nMenurut Tommy, kenaikan HR CPO tersebut dipicu oleh meningkatnya permintaan di tengah penurunan produksi.\n\n“Peningkatan ini disebabkan oleh naiknya permintaan sebagai antisipasi Hari Raya Imlek dan Ramadan, yang tidak diiringi dengan peningkatan suplai akibat penurunan produksi,” kata Tommy dalam keterangan tertulis, Jumat (30/1/2026).\n\nAdapun penetapan HR CPO mengacu pada rata-rata harga dari sejumlah bursa, yakni Bursa CPO Indonesia sebesar US$855,66/MT, Bursa CPO Malaysia US$981,28/MT, serta harga CPO di Pelabuhan Rotterdam yang mencapai US$1.209,81/MT.\n\nDari ketiga sumber tersebut, perhitungan akhir menggunakan rata-rata dua harga median sehingga menghasilkan HR CPO sebesar US$918,47/MT.\n\nSementara itu, pemerintah menetapkan Bea Keluar (BK) CPO untuk Februari 2026 tetap sebesar US$74 per MT.

This figure is higher than the initial target, namely 80,000 ounces of gold for 2026.\n\nAlso Read\n\nBoyke also said that this mine is managed as an open pit mine with ore reserves (Ore Reserve) of around 4.8 million ounces of gold and a mineral resource estimate (Mineral Resource Estimate) of more than 7 million ounces of gold, making it one of the most prospective primary gold mines in Indonesia.\n\nFurthermore, Boyke said that along with the start of heap leach production, EMAS had started the Carbon-In-Leach (CIL) construction phase, with earthwork work already underway since early 2026, faster than the original expectation of 2027.\n\nApart from that, this subsidiary of PT Merdeka Copper Gold Tbk (MDKA) is also accelerating the CIL facility of 12 million tonnes of ore per year which is now targeted for completion in 2028, compared to the initial plan (first phase of 7 million tonnes in 2029 and expansion of 5 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes in 2032).\n\nAccording to Boyke, with this acceleration, EMAS is targeting potential production of around 500,000 ounces of gold per year to be achieved in 2029, faster than the previous projection of 2032.\n\nIn addition, ahead of the production phase, the Pani Gold Mine has completed all major development and commissioning stages, including initial mining, Ore Preparation Plant (OPP) facilities, heap leach, and ADR facilities, so it is ready to enter the full commercial gold production stage.\n\n\"In addition to strengthening the Merdeka Group's gold portfolio, the Pani Gold Mine also makes a real contribution to Indonesia's gold production and Gorontalo's economic development through job creation and community empowerment programs,\" said Boyke.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA - Japan will invest an initial US$36 billion in critical oil, gas and mineral projects in the United States (US), marking the realization of the first phase of its US$550 billion commitment in a trade deal with US President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Our great trade deal with Japan has just begun! The scale of this project is enormous, and it would not be possible without one very special word, tariffs,\" Trump wrote in a post on his social media as reported by Bloomberg, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi stated that the investment was designed to build a resilient supply chain through cooperation in strategic sectors for economic security, including critical minerals, energy and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\"We believe this initiative is fully aligned with its primary goals: promoting mutual benefits for Japan and the United States, ensuring economic security, and spurring growth,\" he said.\n\nThe largest investment will focus on building a natural gas facility in Ohio that is estimated to be capable of generating up to 9.2 gigawatts (GW) of electricity, according to a statement by US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Trump called this project the largest in history.\n\nJapan is projected to invest US$33 billion in the project, which will be led by SoftBank Group Corp.'s subsidiary, SB Energy.\n\nIf fully operational, the plant's capacity is equivalent to nine nuclear reactors or sufficient for the electricity needs of around 7.4 million households on the largest electricity grid in the US managed by PJM Interconnection LLC.\n\nThe second project includes a deepwater crude oil export facility in the Gulf of Mexico. The US$2.1 billion investment will be allocated to the Texas GulfLink export terminal operated by Sentinel Midstream. The facility is estimated to be able to generate US crude oil exports of up to US$30 billion per year when fully operational.\n\nIn addition, Japan will also invest in synthetic industrial diamond manufacturing facilities in Georgia. The US$ 600 million project involves Element Six, a subsidiary of De Beers. Synthetic diamonds are valued as an important component in industrial production and advanced technology.\n\nJapan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Minoru Kihara, confirmed that the two governments would continue to coordinate to finalize technical details and speed up the realization of the project.\n\nThis announcement is an important milestone in the implementation of the trade pact that Trump announced last year. Under the deal, the US imposed a 15% tariff on Japanese products, including reduced import duties on vehicles - a crucial sector for the Japanese economy - in return for a US$550 billion investment commitment.\n\nThe meeting between Trump and Takaichi in Washington which is scheduled for March 19 is expected to make investment implementation the main agenda.\n\nJapanese Trade Minister Ryosei Akazawa previously emphasized that the funded projects would not be high risk, but would be oriented towards relatively safe returns. Of the total scheme of US$550 billion, only around 1%–2% will be direct cash investments, with the rest in the form of loans and credit guarantees.\n\nIn his statement, Lutnick emphasized that the financing structure was designed so that Japan would get investment returns, while the US would get strategic assets, expand industrial capacity and strengthen energy dominance.\n\nThe surge in electricity demand, especially from new data centers along with the AI ​​boom, is considered to make investing in power plants very relevant. Previously, the two countries had identified potential projects with a value ranging from US$350 million to US$100 billion during Trump's visit to Japan last year, including the involvement of companies such as Toshiba Corp. and Westinghouse.\n\nThe agreement also contains a provision that Japan has 45 working days to realize the funding after project is selected. If funding is cancelled, the US reserves the right to withdraw some of the revenue or even reimpose higher tariffs.\n\nTrump previously threatened to increase tariffs to 25% before finally agreeing to a 15% tariff after Japan increased investment commitments.\n\nHudson Institute senior analyst William Chou assesses that the three projects reflect the shared priorities of the US and Japan in the energy, AI and semiconductor sectors, while also fitting with Japan's industrial advantages in the US market.\n\n\"This announcement maintains political momentum ahead of PM Takaichi's visit to Washington next month and shows that Japan is an ally that keeps its commitments,\" he said.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA - Jepang akan menggelontorkan investasi awal US$36 miliar untuk proyek minyak, gas, dan mineral kritis di Amerika Serikat (AS), menandai realisasi tahap pertama dari komitmen US$550 miliar dalam kesepakatan dagang dengan Presiden AS Donald Trump.\n\n\"Kesepakatan dagang besar kami dengan Jepang baru saja dimulai! Skala proyek ini sangat besar, dan tidak mungkin terwujud tanpa satu kata yang sangat istimewa, tarif,\" tulis Trump dalam unggahan di media sosialnya sebagaimana dilansir dariBloomberg, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nPerdana Menteri Jepang Sanae Takaichi menyatakan investasi tersebut dirancang untuk membangun rantai pasok yang tangguh melalui kerja sama di sektor-sektor strategis bagi keamanan ekonomi, termasuk mineral kritis, energi, dan kecerdasan buatan (artificial intelligence/AI).\n\n“Kami meyakini inisiatif ini sepenuhnya selaras dengan tujuan utamanya: mendorong manfaat timbal balik bagi Jepang dan Amerika Serikat, menjamin keamanan ekonomi, serta memacu pertumbuhan,” ujarnya.\n\nInvestasi terbesar akan difokuskan pada pembangunan fasilitas gas alam di Ohio yang diperkirakan mampu menghasilkan listrik hingga 9,2 gigawatt (GW), menurut pernyataan Menteri Perdagangan AS Howard Lutnick. Trump menyebut proyek ini sebagai yang terbesar dalam sejarah.\n\nJepang diproyeksikan menanamkan US$33 miliar pada proyek tersebut, yang akan dipimpin anak usaha SoftBank Group Corp., yakni SB Energy.\n\nJika beroperasi penuh, kapasitas pembangkit tersebut setara dengan sembilan reaktor nuklir atau mencukupi kebutuhan listrik sekitar 7,4 juta rumah tangga pada jaringan listrik terbesar di AS yang dikelola PJM Interconnection LLC.\n\nProyek kedua mencakup fasilitas ekspor minyak mentah laut dalam di Teluk Meksiko. Investasi senilai US$2,1 miliar akan dialokasikan untuk terminal ekspor Texas GulfLink yang dioperasikan Sentinel Midstream. Fasilitas tersebut diperkirakan mampu menghasilkan ekspor minyak mentah AS hingga US$30 miliar per tahun saat beroperasi penuh.\n\nSelain itu, Jepang juga akan berinvestasi pada fasilitas manufaktur berlian industri sintetis di Georgia. Proyek senilai US$600 juta itu melibatkan Element Six, anak usaha De Beers. Berlian sintetis dinilai sebagai komponen penting dalam produksi industri dan teknologi canggih.\n\nKepala Sekretaris Kabinet Jepang, Minoru Kihara, memastikan kedua pemerintah akan terus berkoordinasi guna merampungkan detail teknis dan mempercepat realisasi proyek.\n\nPengumuman ini menjadi tonggak penting dalam implementasi pakta dagang yang diumumkan Trump tahun lalu. Di bawah kesepakatan tersebut, AS menetapkan tarif sebesar 15% untuk produk Jepang, termasuk penurunan bea masuk kendaraan— sektor krusial bagi perekonomian Jepang— sebagai imbal balik atas komitmen investasi US$550 miliar.\n\nPertemuan antara Trump dan Takaichi di Washington yang dijadwalkan pada 19 Maret mendatang diperkirakan akan menjadikan implementasi investasi sebagai agenda utama.\n\nMenteri Perdagangan Jepang Ryosei Akazawa sebelumnya menegaskan proyek-proyek yang didanai tidak akan berisiko tinggi, melainkan berorientasi pada imbal hasil yang relatif aman. Dari total skema US$550 miliar, hanya sekitar 1%–2% yang akan berupa investasi tunai langsung, sementara sisanya dalam bentuk pinjaman dan penjaminan kredit.\n\nDalam pernyataannya, Lutnick menegaskan struktur pembiayaan dirancang agar Jepang memperoleh imbal hasil investasi, sementara AS mendapatkan aset strategis, perluasan kapasitas industri, serta penguatan dominasi energi.\n\nLonjakan permintaan listrik, terutama dari pusat data baru seiring booming AI, dinilai membuat investasi pembangkit listrik menjadi sangat relevan. Sebelumnya, kedua negara telah mengidentifikasi proyek potensial dengan nilai berkisar US$350 juta hingga US$100 miliar dalam kunjungan Trump ke Jepang tahun lalu, termasuk keterlibatan perusahaan seperti Toshiba Corp. dan Westinghouse.\n\nKesepakatan tersebut juga memuat ketentuan bahwa Jepang memiliki waktu 45 hari kerja untuk merealisasikan pendanaan setelah proyek dipilih. Jika batal mendanai, AS berhak menarik kembali sebagian pendapatan atau bahkan memberlakukan kembali tarif yang lebih tinggi.\n\nTrump sebelumnya sempat mengancam menaikkan tarif hingga 25% sebelum akhirnya menyepakati tarif 15% setelah Jepang meningkatkan komitmen investasi.\n\nAnalis senior Hudson Institute, William Chou, menilai ketiga proyek mencerminkan prioritas bersama AS dan Jepang di sektor energi, AI, dan semikonduktor, sekaligus sesuai dengan keunggulan industri Jepang di pasar AS.\n\n“Pengumuman ini menjaga momentum politik menjelang kunjungan PM Takaichi ke Washington bulan depan dan menunjukkan bahwa Jepang adalah sekutu yang menepati komitmennya,” ujarnya.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA -- Indonesia's economic transformation is proceeding slowly following the large contribution of the agricultural sector to the structure of Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP). On the other hand, manufacturing's contribution to GDP is stuck at 19% and over the last 8 years, its contribution to GDP has never returned to 20%. Apart from that, manufacturing productivity is now being highlighted by the World Bank, aka the World Bank.\n\nThe World Bank in its latest report stated that behind the surge in investment in the last 5 years, the majority of capital flows flowed heavily to low value added sectors, thus contributing to the decline in national manufacturing productivity.\n\nBased on the Country Growth & Jobs Report: Indonesia document released at the end of January 2026, the World Bank revealed that Indonesia's investment level has reached an average of 30% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the last 15 years. \"Nevertheless, around 70% of this investment flows into the low value-added manufacturing sector,\" wrote the World Bank in its report, quoted on Tuesday (17/2/2026).\n\nThis Washington DC-based institution noted that 70% of Indonesia's investment realization was sucked into the processed food industry, basic metals, as well as accommodation and food services due to the push of the commodity cycle.\n\nCurrent conditions are inversely proportional to the flow of capital to export-oriented and high-value manufacturing, such as automotive, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and information and communications technology (ICT). In fact, the World Bank explains that these sectors became prime investment targets in the early to mid-1990s, driven by trade reform and deregulation.\n\nThe problem is, after that, there was a trend of market restrictions in the country. As a result, according to the World Bank, this phenomenon is the cause of the decline in Indonesia's manufacturing productivity by 20% to 30% compared to its glory era in the early 1990s.\n\nAlso Read\n\n\"Increasing market restrictions have protected leading companies and state-owned companies from competition, concentrating activity on low-value manufacturing and services,\" the report said.\n\nThe World Bank admits that the Indonesian government has not remained silent watching this decline through the ratification of the Job Creation Law in 2020 and various business regulatory reforms. The sweeping rules are designed to liberalize the business sector and loosen restrictions on foreign direct investment.\n\nThis step is acknowledged to have succeeded in triggering an increase in investment commitment in these sectors. However, the realization that came in turned out to be 'far from the fire'. \"Actual investment flows are still far from expectations, largely due to various challenges in implementing [the Job Creation Law] in the field,\" explained the report.\n\nAccording to Business records, the quality of investment continues to decline, at least when viewed from the perspective of employment. During 2025, the increase in investment will not be commensurate with the increase in labor absorption.\n\nBased on data from the Ministry of Investment and Downstreaming/Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM), investment realization reached IDR 1,931.2 trillion throughout 2025. From this investment realization, employment reached 2,710,532 people.\n\nThus, every 1 worker absorbed requires an investment of around IDR 712.48 million.\n\nWhen compared with the same period last year or throughout 2024, investment realization 'only' reached IDR 1,714.2 trillion (IDR 217 trillion or 12.66% lower than this year's realization). Nevertheless, employment reached 2,456,130 people.\n\nThus, every 1 person employed requires an investment of around IDR 698.1 million (cheaperly IDR 13.8 million).\n\nThis means that there is a decrease in the ratio of labor absorption to investment realization: labor absorption actually worsens when the value of direct investment grows positively.\n\nJust for the record, the processing and agricultural industries are actually experiencing significant growth quite impressive in 2025. Both sectors recorded the highest growth records since 2015, namely above 5%.\n\nThe manufacturing sector or processing industry as a whole grew 5.3% (YoY) throughout 2025, higher than in 2024, namely 4.43%. Meanwhile, the agricultural sector's growth is very exponential, reaching 5.3%. Apart from the realization of economic growth, this figure has shot up from 2024 which was only 0.6%.\n\n\"If we look at the contribution to cumulative economic growth in 2025, in terms of the business sector, the processing industry is the source of the highest growth at 1.07%. This figure is the highest in the last four years,\" said Head of BPS Amalia Adininggar Widyasanti at a press conference, Thursday (5/2/2026).\n\nEven though they recorded the highest growth records, the performance of the two sectors was not without records. The manufacturing sector, for example, grew when imports of raw materials fell and labor-intensive sectors came under pressure.\n\nThe pressure in the labor-intensive sector can be seen from the high number of layoffs and the increasingly ineffectiveness of investment in absorbing labor. The contribution of the manufacturing sector has never reached 20%, at least since 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, the agricultural sector, which grew 5.33% (YoY) last year, has also become a source of economic growth. The figure was even the highest in four years, namely 0.60%. This source of growth has exceeded the 2022 level, which at that time was still 0.29%.\n\nHowever, the high growth and contribution of the agricultural sector to GDP is not always encouraging news for the economy. The reason is, this can also be interpreted as a sign of stagnation in the process of transforming the Indonesian economy from an agrarian society towards industrialization.\n\nExecutive Director of the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef) Esther Sri Astuti believes that nothing has actually changed in the structure of the Indonesian economy, because agriculture has consistently been a large contributor to the Indonesian economy. The difference is that the manufacturing industry is acknowledged to be experiencing degradation.\n\n\"From the past, the agricultural sector has still contributed greatly, and the manufacturing industry has experienced degradation,\" he explained to Bisnis, Monday (16/2/2026).\n\nIn detail, Esther saw that high growth in the manufacturing sector did not reflect growth in the labor-intensive sector. In the field, it is acknowledged that sectors that are labor intensive or create large employment opportunities are still experiencing difficulties.\n\nOne of them is the textile sector. Esther sees that the challenges experienced by the textile sector come from various sides, from expensive raw materials to the onslaught of imported clothing.  \"Even in the domestic market, we get attacks from a collection of products like China, right, which are much cheaper in price and better in quality. Well, that's China's strategy, right,\" said Esther to Bisnis, Monday (16/2/2026).\n\nNot only as a result of the attack on imported clothes, Esther also highlighted fundamental problems in the textile sector. In terms of investment, the lecturer at the Faculty of Economics and Business, Diponegoro University (FEB Undip) also believes that the government needs to bring in more investors in the textile sector to create an ecosystem from upstream to downstream.\n\nAccording to him, some entrepreneurs already have sophisticated production equipment. However, the quality is still less competitive with foreign industries when viewed from the perspective of human resource development.\n\n\"The problem with models, fashion, style, we have very few textile schools. Meanwhile in the US, from textile schools, from vocational schools to universities, they are complete, they already exist. Well, we only have textile schools. The fundamental problem must be corrected, if we want to make our textiles survive and return to their glory like in the 90s,\" he explained.\n\nThe Indonesian Employers' Association (Apindo) said that 9 of the 16 manufacturing subsectors were still growing h national average throughout 2025. This condition reflects the real pressure that business actors in the real sector are still feeling.\n\nGeneral Chairperson of Apindo Shinta W. Kamdani said that in aggregate Indonesia's economic growth was still in a relatively solid range, conditions on the ground showed an uneven recovery. According to him, macro growth figures do not fully reflect the operational challenges faced by industry, especially manufacturing.\n\n\"So in general, I think there are still a lot of things, especially in the manufacturing industry, that are still experiencing a lot of slowdown,\" said Shinta at the Kempinski Hotel Jakarta, Tuesday (10/2/2026).\n\nThis can be seen from the performance of a number of strategic subsectors which grew lower than the national average, some even experiencing contraction. The performance of several subsectors was recorded as relatively low. The textile industry only grew 3.55%, footwear 3.31%, paper 3.36% and furniture 1.60%. The metal goods, computers, electronic goods and electrical equipment industry also grew 4.58% or still below national growth.\n\nOn the other hand, the wood and rattan industry contracted -3.29%, tobacco processing -1.37%, transportation equipment 2.65%, and the rubber and plastic goods industry -4.07%.  \"Isone numbers are like that, but we look more at the real conditions, how we operate in the field, and what kind of challenges we operate in the field,\" he said.\n\nShinta assesses that the challenge in 2026 is not only about maintaining the rate of economic growth, but ensuring that this growth is able to create structural strengthening in the real sector. He emphasized the importance of a strategy that focuses on improving the fundamentals of the business world.\n\nOne of the crucial issues that Apindo continues to highlight is the high cost of doing business in Indonesia. Logistics costs, energy and loan interest rates are considered to be far less competitive than neighboring countries, thereby suppressing the competitiveness of national industry. \"The interest rate on our loans can be up to 8 to 12%, whereas in other countries it's only 4% to 6%. So this is a cost of doing business that we also need to pay attention to,\" he explained.\n\nApart from quantitative costs, Shinta also highlighted non-quantitative costs such as complicated licensing, overlapping regulations, and policy inconsistencies between the center and regions. According to Shinta, this condition also hampers investment, which has been the main motor of economic growth.",

    "title_original": "Transformasi Ekonomi Berjalan Pelan, Manufaktur RI Disorot Bank Dunia",
    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA -- Transformasi ekonomi Indonesia berjalan pelan menyusul masih besarnya kontribusi sektor pertanian dalam struktur produk domestik bruto (PDB) Indonesia. Di sisi lain, kontribusi manufaktur ke PDB mentok di angka 19% dan selama 8 tahun terakhir, kontribusinya ke PDB tidak pernah kembali ke angka 20%. Selain itu produktivitas manufaktur-pun kini disorot Bank Dunia aliasWorld Bank.\n\nBank Dunia dalam laporan terbarunya mengemukakan bahwa di balik guyuran investasi yang naik dalam waktu 5 tahun terakhir, mayoritas aliran modal tersebut mengalir deras ke sektor bernilai tambah rendah sehingga turut menjadi penyebab anjloknya produktivitas manufaktur nasional.\n\nBerdasarkan dokumenCountry Growth & Jobs Report: Indonesiayang dirilis akhir Januari 2026, Bank Dunia mengungkapkan tingkat investasi RI rata-rata mencapai 30% terhadap Produk Domestik Bruto (PDB) dalam 15 tahun terakhir. \"Kendati demikian, sekitar 70% dari investasi ini mengalir ke sektor manufaktur bernilai-tambah rendah,\" tulis Bank Dunia dalam laporannya, dikutip Selasa (17/2/2026).\n\nLembaga yang bermarkas di Washington DC ini mencatat 70% realisasi investasi Indonesia tersedot ke industri makanan olahan, logam dasar, serta layanan akomodasi dan makanan akibat dorongan siklus komoditas.\n\nKondisi saat ini berbanding terbalik dengan aliran modal ke manufaktur berorientasi ekspor dan bernilai tinggi, seperti otomotif, elektronik, farmasi, dan teknologi informasi dan komunikasi (TIK). Padahal, Bank Dunia menjelaskan sektor-sektor tersebut menjadi primadona investasi pada awal hingga pertengahan 1990-an, yang didorong oleh reformasi perdagangan dan deregulasi.\n\nMasalahnya, setelah itu, terjadi tren pembatasan pasar di Tanah Air. Akibatnya, menurut Bank Dunia, fenomena tersebut menjadi biang kerok anjloknya produktivitas manufaktur Indonesia sebesar 20% hingga 30% dibandingkan era kejayaannya di awal 1990-an.\n\nBaca Juga\n\n\"Meningkatnya pembatasan pasar telah melindungi perusahaan-perusahaan terkemuka dan perusahaan milik negara dari persaingan, memusatkan aktivitas pada manufaktur dan jasa yang bernilai rendah,\" ungkap laporan tersebut.\n\nBank Dunia mengakui bahwa pemerintah Indonesia sebenarnya tidak tinggal diam melihat kemerosotan ini lewat pengesahan UU Cipta Kerja pada 2020 dan berbagai reformasi regulasi bisnis. Aturan sapu jagat itu dirancang untuk meliberalisasi sektor usaha dan melonggarkan batasan investasi asing langsung.\n\nLangkah ini diakui memang berhasil memicu kenaikan komitmen investasi di sektor-sektor tersebut. Hanya saja, realisasi yang masuk ternyata ‘jauh panggang dari api’. \"Aliran investasi aktual masih jauh dari harapan, sebagian besar disebabkan oleh berbagai tantangan implementasi [UU Cipta Kerja] di lapangan,\" jelas laporan tersebut.\n\nDalam catatanBisnis, kualitas investasi terus menurun, setidaknya apabila dilihat dari sisi penyerapan tenaga kerja. Selama 2025, kenaikan investasi tidak sebanding dengan kenaikan penyerapan tenaga kerja.\n\nBerdasarkan data Kementerian Investasi dan Hilirisasi/Badan Koordinasi Penanaman Modal (BKPM), realisasi investasi mencapai Rp1.931,2 triliun sepanjang 2025. Dari realisasi investasi itu, penyerapan tenaga kerjanya mencapai 2.710.532 orang.\n\nDengan demikian, setiap 1 tenaga kerja yang terserap memerlukan investasi sekitar Rp712,48 juta.\n\nApabila dibandingkan dengan periode yang sama tahun lalu atau sepanjang 2024, realisasi investasi 'hanya' mencapai Rp1.714,2 triliun (lebih rendah Rp217 triliun atau 12,66% dibandingkan realisasi tahun ini). Kendati demikian, penyerapan tenaga kerjanya mencapai 2.456.130 orang.\n\nDengan demikian, setiap 1 orang tenaga kerja terserap 'hanya' memerlukan investasi sekitar Rp698,1 juta (lebih 'murah' Rp13,8 juta).\n\nArtinya, terjadi penurunan rasio penyerapan tenaga kerja terhadap realisasi investasi: serapan tenaga kerja malah memburuk ketika nilai investasi langsung tumbuh positif.\n\nSekadar catatan, industri pengolahan dan pertanian sejatinya mengalami pertumbuhan yang cukup impresif pada tahun 2025. Kedua sektor itu mencatat rekor pertumbuhan tertinggi sejak 2015 lalu yakni di atas 5%.\n\nSektor manufaktur atau industri pengolahan secara keseluruhan tumbuh 5,3% (YoY) sepanjang 2025, lebih tinggi dibandingkan tahun 2024 yakni 4,43%. Sementara itu, sektor pertanian pertumbuhannya sangat eksponensial menembus angka 5,3%. Selain di atas realisasi pertumbuhan ekonomi, angka itu melesat dari tahun 2024 yang hanya 0,6%.\n\n\"Jika dilihat dari kontribusi pertumbuhan ekonomi secara kumulatif pada 2025, dari sisi lapangan usaha, industri pengolahan menjadi sumber pertumbuhan tertinggi sebesar 1,07%. Angka ini merupakan yang tertinggi selama empat tahun terakhir,\" ucap Kepala BPS Amalia Adininggar Widyasanti pada konferensi pers, Kamis (5/2/2026).\n\nMeski mencatat rekor pertumbuhan tertinggi, kinerja kedua sektor itu bukannya tanpa catatan. Sektor manufaktur, misalnya, tumbuh ketika impor bahan baku turun dan sektor padat karya mengalami tekanan.\n\nAdapun tekanan di sektor padat karya tampak dari tingginya angka pemutusan hubungan kerja dan semakin tidak efektifnya investasi dalam menyerap tenaga kerja. Kontribusi sektor manufaktur-pun tidak pernah bisa menyentuh angka 20%, setidaknya sejak 2018.\n\nSementara itu, sektor pertanian yang sepanjang tahun lalu tumbuh 5,33% (YoY), juga telah menjadi sumber pertumbuhan ekonomi. Angkanya bahkan tertinggi dalam empat tahun yakni 0,60%. Sumber pertumbuhan itu sudah melebihi level 2022 yang saat itu masih 0,29%.\n\nNamun demikian, tingginya pertumbuhan dan kontribusi sektor pertanian ke PDB, tidak selamanya menjadi kabar yang menggembirakan bagi perekonomian. Pasalnya, hal itu juga bisa dimaknai sebagai tanda-tanda terjadinya stagnasi dalam proses transformasi ekonomi Indonesia dari masyarakat agraris ke arah industrialisasi.\n\nDirektur Eksekutif Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef) Esther Sri Astuti memandang sejatinya tidak ada yang berubah pada struktur perekonomian Indonesia, lantaran pertanian memang konsisten menjadi kontributor besar terhadap perekonomian Indonesia. Bedanya, industri manufaktur diakui tengah mengalami degradasi.\n\n\"Dari dulu sektor pertanian juga masih berkontribusi besar, dan industri manufaktur yang mengalami degradasi gitu,\" terangnya kepadaBisnis, Senin (16/2/2026).\n\nSecara terperinci, Esther melihat bahwa pertumbuhan yang tinggi pada sektor manufaktur tidak mencerminkan pertumbuhan pada sektor padat karya. Di lapangan, sektor yang bersifat labor intensive atau menciptakan lapangan kerja besar itu diakui justru masih mengalami kesulitan.\n\nSalah satunya adalah sektor tekstil. Esther melihat tantangan yang dialami sektor tekstil datang dari berbagai sisi, mulai dari mahalnya bahan baku hingga gempuran baju asal impor.  \"Di pasar domestik pun itu kan kita dapat serangan ya dari kumpulan produk-produk kayak China, gitu kan,which isyang jauh lebih murah harganya dan lebih bagus juga kualitasnya. Nah itu memang strateginya China, ya,\" kata Esther kepada Bisnis, Senin (16/2/2026).\n\nTidak hanya akibat serangan baju impor, Esther turut menyoroti masalah fundamental pada sektor tekstil. Dari segi investasi, dosen Fakultas Ekonomika dan Bisnis Universitas Diponegoro (FEB Undip) itu juga menilai pemerintah perlu mendatangkan lebih banyak investor di sektor tekstil agar terciptanya ekosistem dari hulu hingga ke hilir.\n\nMenurutnya, sebagian pengusaha sudah memiliki alat produksi yang canggih. Namun, kualitasnya masih kalah saing dengan industri luar negeri apabila dilihat dari sisi pengembangan SDM.\n\n\"Masalah model,fashion,style, kita tuh sekolah tekstil kan sangat kurang. Sementara kalau di US, itu dari sekolah tekstil, itu dari SMK sampai universitas sudah lengkap, sudah ada. Nah kita kan cuma ada sekolah tekstil.Fundamental problem-nya harus dibenerin, kalau ingin bikin tekstil kitasurvivedan kembali jaya seperti tahun 90-an,\" terangnya.\n\nAsosiasi Pengusaha Indonesia (Apindo) menyebut 9 dari 16 subsektor manufaktur masih tumbuh di bawah rata-rata nasional sepanjang 2025. Kondisi tersebut mencerminkan tekanan nyata yang masih dirasakan pelaku usaha di sektor riil.\n\nKetua Umum Apindo Shinta W. Kamdani mengatakan secara agregat pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia masih berada di kisaran yang relatif solid, kondisi di lapangan menunjukkan pemulihan yang tidak merata. Menurutnya, angka pertumbuhan makro belum sepenuhnya merefleksikan tantangan operasional yang dihadapi industri, khususnya manufaktur.\n\n“Jadi in general saya rasa banyak sekali masih, terutama di industri manufaktur masih mengalami banyak perlambatan,” kata Shinta di Hotel Kempinski Jakarta, Selasa (10/2/2026).\n\nHal ini terlihat dari kinerja sejumlah subsektor strategis yang tumbuh lebih rendah dibandingkan rata-rata nasional, bahkan ada yang mengalami kontraksi. Kinerja beberapa subsektor tercatat relatif rendah. Industri tekstil hanya tumbuh 3,55%, alas kaki 3,31%, kertas 3,36% dan furnitur 1,60%. Industri barang logam, komputer, barang elektronik dan peralatan listrik juga tumbuh 4,58% atau masih di bawah pertumbuhan nasional.\n\nDi sisi lain, industri kayu dan rotan kontraksi -3,29%, pengolahan tembakau -1,37%, alat angkutan 2,65%, dan industri karet serta barang plastik -4,07%.  \"Angka isone thinggitu, tapi kita lebih melihat kondisi riil itu bagaimana kita beroperasi di lapangan, dan tantangan-tantangannya seperti apa kita beroperasi di lapangan,\" tuturnya.\n\nShinta menilai tantangan pada 2026 tidak hanya soal menjaga laju pertumbuhan ekonomi, tetapi memastikan pertumbuhan tersebut mampu menciptakan penguatan struktural di sektor riil. Dia menekankan pentingnya strategi yang berfokus pada perbaikan fundamental dunia usaha.\n\nSalah satu isu krusial yang terus disoroti Apindo adalah tingginya biaya berusaha (high cost of doing business) di Indonesia. Biaya logistik, energi, hingga suku bunga pinjaman dinilai masih jauh kurang kompetitif dibanding negara-negara tetangga, sehingga menekan daya saing industri nasional. “Suku bunga pinjaman kita itu bisa sampai 8 sampai 12%, kalau negara lain cuma 4% sampai 6%-an. Jadi ini menjadi cost of doing business yang harus menjadi perhatian kita juga,\" jelasnya.\n\nSelain biaya yang bersifat kuantitatif, Shinta juga menyoroti beban non-kuantitatif seperti perizinan yang berbelit, regulasi yang tumpang tindih, serta inkonsistensi kebijakan antara pusat dan daerah. Menurut Shinta, kondisi tersebut turut menghambat investasi, yang selama ini menjadi motor utama pertumbuhan ekonomi.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — The plan to increase cotton purchases from the United States (US) is considered difficult to realize amidst the low utilization of the domestic spinning industry. This condition means that demand for raw materials has not been able to recover to what it was before the pandemic.\n\nIn fact, the plan to increase cotton purchases from the US is part of the negotiation steps to reduce trade tariffs to 19% for products from Indonesia.\n\nChairman of the Indonesian Fiber and Filament Yarn Producers Association (APSyFI), Redma G. Wirawasta, said that the pressure on the upstream textile industry was still very heavy. Weakening domestic market demand and the invasion of imported products means production capacity is not optimal.\n\n\"The US asked us to buy more cotton from them. This will be difficult to implement as long as our spinning industry's utilization is still below 50%,\" said Redma to Bisnis, Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nBefore the pandemic, Indonesia's total cotton imports reached around 600,000 tons per year. Of this amount, around 300,000 tonnes came from the US, making Uncle Sam's country one of the main suppliers of raw materials for the national textile industry.\n\nHowever, since 2022 the import trend has continued to decline. Until 2025, Indonesia's total cotton imports will only be around 300,000 tons, with the share from the US shrinking drastically to around 70,000 tons.\n\nAlso Read\n\nRedma emphasized that as long as the utilization rate does not improve, increasing imports is almost impossible.\n\n\"So as long as the utilization of the spinning industry is below 50%, it is unlikely that our cotton imports from the US will increase,\" he stressed.\n\nAccording to him, low utilization is not without reason. The spinning industry is facing pressure from the flood of imported products, both in the form of cloth and yarn, which are sold at very competitive prices, and are even suspected of being dumped.\n\nThis condition means that the domestic market, which should be the main support, is actually being eroded by foreign products. Without a healthy market and fair competition, domestic industry has difficulty increasing production.\n\n\"Of course we hope that the US will provide tariff relief so that our exports to the US can become competitive again, even though this will be difficult without improvements on the industrial side,\" he concluded.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Rencana peningkatan pembeliankapas(cotton) dari Amerika Serikat (AS) dinilai sulit direalisasikan di tengah rendahnya utilisasi industri pemintalan dalam negeri. Kondisi ini membuat permintaan bahan baku belum mampu pulih seperti sebelum pandemi.\n\nPadahal, rencana peningkatan pembelian kapas dari AS merupakan bagian dari langkah negosiasi penurunan tarif dagang menjadi 19% untuk produk asal Indonesia.\n\nKetua Umum Asosiasi Produsen Serat dan Benang Filamen Indonesia (APSyFI), Redma G. Wirawasta, mengatakan bahwa tekanan pada industri hulu tekstil masih sangat berat. Permintaan pasar domestik yang melemah dan serbuan produk impor membuat kapasitas produksi tidak optimal.\n\n“AS meminta kita membeli lebih banyakcottondari mereka. Hal ini akan sulit dilaksanakan selama industri pemintalan kita utilisasinya masih di bawah 50%,” ujar Redma kepada Bisnis, Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nSebelum pandemi, total impor kapas Indonesia mencapai sekitar 600.000 ton per tahun. Dari jumlah tersebut, sekitar 300.000 ton berasal dari AS, menjadikan Negeri Paman Sam sebagai salah satu pemasok utama bahan baku industri tekstil nasional.\n\nNamun, sejak 2022 tren impor terus mengalami penurunan. Hingga 2025, total impor kapas Indonesia hanya sekitar 300.000 ton, dengan porsi dari AS menyusut drastis menjadi sekitar 70.000 ton.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nRedma menegaskan, selama tingkat utilisasi belum membaik, peningkatan impor hampir mustahil terjadi.\n\n“Jadi selama utilisasi industri pemintalan berada di bawah 50%, kecil kemungkinan impor cotton kita dari AS bisa naik,” tegasnya.\n\nMenurutnya, rendahnya utilisasi bukan tanpa sebab. Industri pemintalan menghadapi tekanan dari membanjirnya produk impor, baik berupa kain maupun benang, yang dijual dengan harga sangat kompetitif, bahkan diduga dilakukan secara dumping.\n\nKondisi tersebut membuat pasar domestik yang seharusnya menjadi penopang utama justru tergerus oleh produk luar negeri. Tanpa pasar yang sehat dan persaingan yang adil, industri dalam negeri kesulitan meningkatkan produksi.\n\n“Tentunya kami berharap AS akan memberikan keringanan tarif agar ekspor kita ke AS bisa kembali bersaing, meskipun hal itu sulit tanpa ada perbaikan di sisi industrinya,” tutupnya.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Negotiations on a trade agreement between Indonesia and the United States (US) will soon enter a new phase as a meeting will be held between President Prabowo Subianto and President Donald Trump on February 19 2026.\n\nA number of businessmen also conveyed a series of important notes that the government needed to pay attention to before the signing of the trade agreement with the US. This is because the latest US tariff policy towards Indonesia in the future will have an impact on the industrial sector in the country.\n\nThe Association of Fiber and Filament Yarn Producers (APSyFI) still hopes that the government will be able to negotiate lower tariffs with the US.\n\nThe textile and textile products (TPT) industry hopes that the reciprocal tariff, which is currently at the level of 19%, can be pushed lower so that the competitiveness of exports to Uncle Sam's country can recover.\n\nAPSyFI General Chair Redma Gita Wirawasta said that the United States market is still one of the main destinations for Indonesian textile exports. However, the tariff burden is considered to make it difficult for national products to compete with other countries that receive more competitive treatment.\n\n\"Of course we hope that the US will provide tariff relief so that our exports to the US can become competitive again, even though this is difficult without improvements on the industrial side,\" said Redma to Bisnis, Tuesday (17/2/2026).\n\nAlso Read\n\nIn these negotiations, the US is said to have asked Indonesia to increase cotton purchases from Uncle Sam's country as one of the conditions for reducing reciprocal tariffs from the previous 32% to 19%. This demand is a challenge in itself amidst conditions in the spinning industry that have not yet fully recovered.\n\nAccording to Redma, increasing cotton imports from the US is difficult to realize if the spinning industry utilization rate is still below 50%. With production capacity not yet optimal, the need for raw materials automatically decreases.\n\n\"This will be difficult to implement as long as our spinning industry's utilization is still below 50%,\" he explained.\n\nAPSyFI data notes that before the Covid-19 pandemic, Indonesia's total cotton imports reached around 600,000 tons per year, with around 300,000 tons coming from the United States. However, since 2022 the import trend has continued to decline significantly.\n\nIn 2025, Indonesia's total cotton imports will be recorded at only around 300,000 tons, with the portion from the United States remaining at around 70,000 tons. This decline reflects sluggish production activity in the spinning sector in recent years.\n\n\"So as long as the utilization of the spinning industry is below 50%, it is unlikely that our cotton imports from the US will increase,\" he explained.\n\nHe added that the low utilization of industry cannot be separated from the flood of imported products which are suspected of being sold through dumping practices, both in the form of cloth and thread. This condition puts pressure on the domestic market and erodes demand for domestic products.\n\n\"It is impossible for spinning utilization to increase as long as dumped imported goods, both cloth and yarn, continue to flood the domestic market. Because the industry's main need is the market and fair competition,\" he said.\n\nThe Indonesian Employers' Association (Apindo) asked the government to make labor-intensive industries a priority for protection in US tariff negotiations. This message was delivered ahead of the finalization of the trade agreement between Prabowo and Trump.\n\nGeneral Chairperson of Apindo Shinta Widjaja Kamdani said the sectors most vulnerable to US tariff policies are labor-intensive industries that have high exposure to Uncle Sam's export market.\n\n\"Regarding US tariff policy, from the perspective of the business world, the most vulnerable sectors are labor-intensive industries which have high exposure to the export market to the United States,\" said Shinta to Bisnis, Monday (16/2/2026).\n\nBased on export data, Shinta explained a number of commodities with significant dependence on the US market. He gave the example that knitted clothing and accessories account for around 61% of exports to the US, furniture and ambient lighting 59%, processed meat/fish/crustaceans around 56%, and leather products around 56%. Meanwhile, non-knitted clothing is around 49%, toys and sports equipment is around 45%, and footwear is around 33%.\n\nAccording to him, the data shows that changes in tariffs will have a direct impact on orders, production capacity utilization levels, and company cash flow, which ultimately has the potential to reduce labor absorption.\n\n\"Therefore, these sectors [labor-intensive industries] need to be a priority for protection in negotiations, considering their contribution to manufacturing and national employment stability,\" he explained.\n\nOn the other hand, Shinta said that Apindo was involved in US reciprocal tariff negotiations by providing industry input, mapping business obstacles, and communicating with business world partners in the US.\n\nApart from that, Shinta assessed that strengthening Indonesia's bargaining position also requires an understanding of the context of US reciprocal tariff policy which aims to balance the trade balance and reduce the trade deficit.\n\n\"Indonesia's approach cannot only be defensive in asking for tariff reductions, but must also offer concrete solutions that answer these interests,\" he explained.\n\nBased on the upload from the official Instagram account @sekretariat.kabinet, President Prabowo summoned Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto, Minister of Finance Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, Minister of State Secretary Prasetyo Hadi, and Minister of Investment and Downstreaming/Head of BKPM and CEO of Danantara Rosan Roeslani.\n\nThe meeting was held at his private residence in Hambalang, Bogor, on Sunday (15/2/2026). During the meeting, the Indonesian Head of State emphasized the importance of ensuring that Indonesia's position in every international economic negotiation is at the most favorable point for national interests, especially regarding tariff negotiations with the US.\n\n\"President Prabowo wants every policy taken to provide concrete benefits as soon as possible and as much as possible for Indonesia,\" he was quoted as saying on the official Instagram account @sekretariat.kabinet, Monday (16/2/2026).\n\nMeanwhile, CSIS researcher Yoshe Rizal Damuri said US tariff pressure could weaken the competitiveness of national products amidst tight global market competition, especially in key markets such as the US and the European Union.\n\nAccording to Yoshe, risks to the supply chain and dependence on imported commodities have also increased along with the protectionist policies adopted by a number of countries. He believes that this condition requires industry players to read market dynamics and the direction of global trade policy more carefully.\n\n\"Our competitors are not always cheaper, but they can benefit from preferential tariffs and clear trade rules,\" said Yoshe to Bisnis, quoted Tuesday (17/2/2026).\n\nHe explained that countries like Vietnam do not necessarily have lower production costs than Indonesia. However, Vietnam's advantage lies in market access through trade agreements that provide more competitive tariffs and regulatory certainty. In the context of the European Union market, for example, Vietnam has previously enjoyed 0% tariffs through a free trade agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Indonesia is still facing higher tariffs so its competitive position is relatively lagging behind. \"In the current situation, it is increasingly important for us to diversify the market,\" he said.\n\nYoshe emphasized that heavy dependence on one market, such as the US, makes national industries more vulnerable when policy changes such as reciprocal tariffs occur. Diversification is considered to be an important strategy to maintain export stability.\n\nApart from tariffs, he also highlighted the trend of increasingly stringent sustainability regulations in various export destination countries. The Indonesian footwear industry needs to prepare to face demands for higher environmental standards and supply chain traceability.\n\n“We also need to be prepared to face stricter sustainability regulations and chain traceability demands I supply,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the government implied that there would be 'surprises' related to the signing of a trade agreement or agreement on reciprocal trade (ART) between Indonesia and the United States (US).\n\nJust for the record, the Indonesian and US governments have completed the entire negotiation process and legal language harmonization process (legal drafting) related to the trade agreement which began with the imposition of import tariffs on Indonesian products in 2025.\n\nFrom initially being threatened with a 32% tariff, President Prabowo Subianto last year agreed with President Donald Trump to reduce import duties on Indonesian products to 19%. In contrast, most US products will be subject to 0% import duties.\n\nAhead of the signing of the trade agreement on February 19 2026, the entire results of the negotiations and preparation of the legal documents for the trade agreement have been submitted to President Prabowo. Coordinating Minister for the Economy Airlangga Hartarto, who led the team of negotiators, also presented the results the day before Prabowo left for the US.\n\n\"The presence of economic ministers in Hambalang [Prabowo's private residence] before the President's departure is a form of final consolidation so that Indonesia's position is solid in the negotiations. \"We hope that there will be positive surprises from ART that will increasingly benefit Indonesia,\" said Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs spokesperson Haryo Limanseto in a press release, Monday (16/2/2026).\n\nHaryo then said that tariff negotiations had been completed and the two countries had completed the process of harmonizing legal language or legal drafting.\n\nIn addition to reducing tariffs to 19%, the US government also excluded tariffs for a number of Indonesia's leading export commodities, including crude palm oil (CPO), coffee and cocoa.",

Pasalnya, kebijakan terbaru tarif AS terhadap Indonesia ke depannya bakal berdampak pada sektor industri di Tanah Air.\n\nAsosiasi Produsen Serat dan Benang Filamen (APSyFI) masih menaruh harapan agar pemerintah mampu menegosiasikan tarif yang lebih rendah dengan AS.\n\nIndustri tekstil dan produk tekstil (TPT) berharap tarif resiprokal yang saat ini berada di level 19% bisa ditekan lebih rendah agar daya saing ekspor ke Negeri Paman Sam kembali pulih.\n\nKetua Umum APSyFI Redma Gita Wirawasta mengatakan, pasar Amerika Serikat masih menjadi salah satu tujuan utama ekspor tekstil Indonesia. Namun, beban tarif dinilai membuat produk nasional sulit bersaing dengan negara lain yang mendapatkan perlakuan lebih kompetitif.\n\n“Tentunya kami berharap AS akan memberikan keringanan tarif agar ekspor kita ke AS bisa kembali bersaing meskipun hal itu sulit tanpa ada perbaikan di sisi industrinya,” ujar Redma kepada Bisnis, Selasa (17/2/2026).\n\nBaca Juga\n\nDalam negosiasi tersebut, AS disebut meminta Indonesia meningkatkan pembelian kapas (cotton) dari Negeri Paman Sam sebagai salah satu syarat penurunan tarif resiprokal dari sebelumnya 32% menjadi 19%. Permintaan itu menjadi tantangan tersendiri di tengah kondisi industri pemintalan yang belum sepenuhnya pulih.\n\nMenurut Redma, peningkatan impor kapas dari AS sulit direalisasikan apabila tingkat utilisasi industri pemintalan masih berada di bawah 50%. Dengan kapasitas produksi yang belum optimal, kebutuhan bahan baku otomatis ikut menurun.\n\n“Hal ini akan sulit dilaksanakan selama industri pemintalan kita utilisasinya masih di bawah 50%,” terangnya.\n\nData APSyFI mencatat, sebelum pandemi Covid-19 total impor kapas Indonesia mencapai sekitar 600.000 ton per tahun, dengan sekitar 300.000 ton berasal dari Amerika Serikat. Namun, sejak 2022 tren impor terus mengalami penurunan signifikan.\n\nPada 2025, total impor kapas Indonesia tercatat hanya sekitar 300.000 ton, dengan porsi dari Amerika Serikat tinggal sekitar 70.000 ton. Penurunan ini mencerminkan lesunya aktivitas produksi di sektor pemintalan dalam beberapa tahun terakhir.\n\n“Jadi selama utilisasi industri pemintalan berada di bawah 50%, kecil kemungkinan impor cotton kita dari AS bisa naik,” jelasnya.\n\nDia menambahkan, rendahnya utilisasi industri tidak lepas dari membanjirnya produk impor yang diduga dijual dengan praktik dumping, baik dalam bentuk kain maupun benang. Kondisi ini membuat pasar domestik tertekan dan menggerus permintaan terhadap produk dalam negeri.\n\n“Utilisasi pemintalan tidak mungkin bisa naik selama barang-barang impor dumping baik kain maupun benang masih membanjiri pasar domestik. Karena kebutuhan utama industri hanyalah pasar dan persaingannya yang fair,” ujarnya.\n\nAsosiasi Pengusaha Indonesia (Apindo) meminta pemerintah menjadikan industri padat karya sebagai prioritas perlindungan dalam negosiasi tarif AS. Pesan ini disampaikan menjelang finalisasi kesepakatan dagang yang bakal oleh Prabowo dan Trump.\n\nKetua Umum Apindo Shinta Widjaja Kamdani mengatakan sektor paling rentan terhadap kebijakan tarif AS adalah industri padat karya yang memiliki eksposur tinggi ke pasar ekspor Negeri Paman Sam.\n\n“Terkait kebijakan tarif AS, dari perspektif dunia usaha, sektor yang paling rentan adalah industri padat karya yang memiliki eksposur tinggi terhadap pasar ekspor ke Amerika Serikat,” kata Shinta kepada Bisnis, Senin (16/2/2026).\n\nBerdasarkan data ekspor, Shinta memaparkan sejumlah komoditas dengan ketergantungan signifikan terhadap pasar AS. Dia mencontohkan, pakaian dan aksesori rajutan mencatat sekitar 61% ekspor ke AS, furnitur dan lampu sekitar 59%, olahan daging/ikan/krustasea sekitar 56%, serta produk kulit sekitar 56%. Adapun pakaian non-rajutan sekitar 49%, mainan dan perlengkapan olahraga sekitar 45%, dan alas kaki sekitar 33%.\n\nMenurutnya, data tersebut menunjukkan perubahan tarif akan berdampak langsung pada pesanan, tingkat utilisasi kapasitas produksi, hingga arus kas perusahaan, yang pada akhirnya berpotensi menekan penyerapan tenaga kerja.\n\n“Karena itu, sektor-sektor ini [industri padat karya] perlu menjadi prioritas perlindungan dalam negosiasi, mengingat kontribusinya terhadap manufaktur dan stabilitas ketenagakerjaan nasional,” terangnya.\n\nDi sisi lain, Shinta menuturkan Apindo ikut terlibat dalam negosiasi tarif resiprokal AS dengan memberi masukan industri, memetakan hambatan usaha, hingga berkomunikasi dengan mitra dunia usaha di AS.\n\nSelain itu, Shinta menilai penguatan posisi tawar Indonesia juga menuntut pemahaman atas konteks kebijakan tarif resiprokal AS yang bertujuan menyeimbangkan neraca perdagangan dan menekan defisit dagang.\n\n“Pendekatan Indonesia tidak bisa hanya defensif meminta penurunan tarif, tetapi juga harus menawarkan solusi konkret yang menjawab kepentingan tersebut,” terangnya.\n\nBerdasarkan unggahan akun Instagram resmi @sekretariat.kabinet, Presiden Prabowo memanggil Menteri Koordinator Bidang Perekonomian Airlangga Hartarto, Menteri Keuangan Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, Menteri Sekretaris Negara Prasetyo Hadi, serta Menteri Investasi dan Hilirisasi/Kepala BKPM sekaligus CEO Danantara Rosan Roeslani.\n\nPertemuan itu dilaksanakan di kediaman pribadinya di Hambalang, Bogor, pada Minggu (15/2/2026). Dalam pertemuan tersebut, Kepala Negara RI menekankan pentingnya memastikan posisi Indonesia dalam setiap perundingan ekonomi internasional berada pada titik yang paling menguntungkan bagi kepentingan nasional, terutama terkait perundingan tarif dengan AS.\n\n“Presiden Prabowo menginginkan setiap kebijakan yang diambil harus sesegera dan sebanyak mungkin memberi keuntungan konkret untuk Indonesia,” demikian dikutip dari akun Instagram resmi @sekretariat.kabinet, Senin (16/2/2026).\n\nSementara itu, Peneliti CSIS Yoshe Rizal Damuri mengatakan tekanan tarif AS dapat memperlemah daya saing produk nasional di tengah ketatnya persaingan pasar global, terutama di pasar utama seperti AS dan Uni Eropa.\n\nMenurut Yoshe, risiko terhadap rantai pasok dan ketergantungan pada komoditas impor juga meningkat seiring kebijakan proteksionis yang ditempuh sejumlah negara. Dia menilai kondisi ini membuat pelaku industri harus lebih cermat membaca dinamika pasar dan arah kebijakan perdagangan global.\n\n“Pesaing kita tidak selalu lebih murah, tetapi mereka bisa diuntungkan oleh tarif preferensial dan aturan perdagangan yang jelas,” ujar Yoshe kepada Bisnis, dikutip Selasa (17/2/2026).\n\nDia menjelaskan, negara seperti Vietnam memang belum tentu memiliki biaya produksi lebih rendah dari Indonesia. Namun, keunggulan Vietnam terletak pada akses pasar melalui perjanjian dagang yang memberikan tarif lebih kompetitif serta kepastian regulasi. Dalam konteks pasar Uni Eropa, misalnya, Vietnam telah lebih dulu menikmati tarif 0% melalui perjanjian dagang bebas.\n\nSementara itu, Indonesia masih menghadapi tarif yang lebih tinggi sehingga posisi kompetitifnya relatif tertinggal. “Dalam situasi saat ini, semakin penting bagi kita untuk melakukan diversifikasi pasar,” tuturnya.\n\nYoshe menekankan bahwa ketergantungan yang besar pada satu pasar, seperti AS, membuat industri nasional lebih rentan ketika terjadi perubahan kebijakan seperti tarif resiprokal. Diversifikasi dinilai menjadi strategi penting untuk menjaga stabilitas ekspor.\n\nSelain soal tarif, ia juga menyoroti tren regulasi keberlanjutan yang semakin ketat di berbagai negara tujuan ekspor. Industri alas kaki Indonesia perlu bersiap menghadapi tuntutan standar lingkungan dan ketertelusuran rantai pasok yang lebih tinggi.\n\n“Kita juga perlu bersiap menghadapi aturan keberlanjutan yang lebih ketat dan tuntutan ketertelusuran rantai pasok,” tuturnya.\n\nSementara itu, pemerintah menyiratkan bahwa akan ada 'kejutan' terkait dengan penandatanganan kesepakatan dagang atauagreement on reciprocal trade(ART) antara Indonesia dan Amerika Serikat (AS).\n\nSekadar catatan, pemerintah Indonesia dan AS telah menyelesaikan seluruh proses negosiasi dan proses harmonisasi bahasa hukum (legal drafting) terkait dengan perjanjian dagang yang diawali dengan pengenaan tarif impor terhadap produk Indonesia 2025 lalu.\n\nDari awalnya diancam dengan tarif 32%, Presiden Prabowo Subianto pada tahun lalu menyepakati dengan Presiden Donald Trump agar tarif bea masuk terhadap produk Indonesia diturunkan ke 19%. Sebaliknya, sebagian besar produk AS akan dikenai bea masuk 0%.\n\nMenjelang penandatanganan kesepakatan dagang pada 19 Februari 2026, keseluruhan hasil negosiasi dan penyusunan dokumen hukum perjanjian dagang itu telah disampaikan kepada Presiden Prabowo. Menko Perekonomian Airlangga Hartarto, yang memimpin tim negosiator, turut menyampaikan hasil dimaksud sehari sebelum Prabowo bertolak ke AS.\n\n\"Hadirnya para menteri bidang ekonomi di Hambalang [kediaman pribadi Prabowo] sebelum keberangkatan Presiden merupakan bentuk konsolidasi akhir agar posisi Indonesia solid dalam perundingan. Kita berharap akan ada kejutan-kejutan positif dari ART yang semakin menguntungkan Indonesia,\" kata Juru Bicara Kemenko Perekonomian Haryo Limanseto melalui siaran pers, Senin (16/2/2026).\n\nHaryo lalu menuturkan bahwa negosiasi tarif telah rampung dan kedua negara telah menyelesaikan proses harmonisasi bahasa hukum atau legal drafting.\n\nSelain tarif turun menjadi 19%, pemerintah AS turut mengecualikan tarif bagi sejumlah komoditas unggulan ekspor Indonesia termasuk minyak kelapa sawit atau crude palm oil (CPO), kopi dan kakao.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Observers view the erosion of people's real income as the main factor that has the potential to suppress mobility for returning home for Eid 2026. As a result, people are more selective in planning trips to their hometowns this year.\n\nThe Ministry of Transportation (Kemenhub) previously predicted a decrease in the number of people going home or traveling during Eid this year by -1.7% compared to the 2025 survey and -6.55% compared to last year's realization.\n\nChairman of the Institute for Transportation Studies and transportation observer Ki Darmaningtyas agrees with the survey results from the Ministry of Transportation. According to him, the decline occurred due to real economic conditions which were still sluggish.\n\n\"If there is a decline, I agree. I predict a decline because the economy is indeed sluggish,\" he said to Business, quoted on Wednesday (18/2/2026).\n\nAccording to him, one of the groups affected is the State Civil Apparatus (ASN), which is a group that contributes to homecoming mobility, due to efficiency and restrictions on official travel.\n\n\"ASN now practically only comes from salaries and performance allowances, so they tend to be barely able to. Previously they had income from official travel, and that's what they saved to go home for Eid,\" he added.\n\nAlso Read\n\nApart from ASN, small business actors such as school canteen managers are also said to be affected by the decline in turnover due to the Free Nutritious Meal (MBG) program, so that the space to set aside savings for going home becomes more limited.\n\nLikewise, Executive Director of the Center of Reform on Economics (Core) Indonesia, Mohammad Faisal, assessed that there are a number of factors that cause a potential decline in the number of homecoming travelers, including falling income.\n\nThis weakening is reflected in data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) for November 2025, which shows a decrease in real labor wages of -0.06% from the August 2025 period. A decrease of -5.29% also occurred in February 2025 compared to August 2024.\n\n\"So it continues to weaken in terms of people's real income and I think the lower middle class is experiencing it more. So this is also what I think is an important factor as to why there is a potential decline in people's mobility during Eid 2026,\" he said.\n\nMoreover, continued Faisal, if some companies or employers pay in installments or are unable to provide THR as large as expected. This condition then affects homecoming plans.\n\nThis is in line with the purchasing power of the lower middle class, which according to Faisal is not very strong.\n\nEven though there has been an increase in total demand and total expenditure in the last five months leading up to Christmas, it is estimated that it will continue until Eid, the retail sales index is still driven by spending from the upper middle class.\n\n\"So some of them are forced to choose to be more selective in shopping, including for going home. For going home, it's not just transportation costs that are calculated,\" continued Faisal.\n\nApart from that, Faisal views that people are increasingly selective in choosing when to return home because of Eid or holidays which are close to New Year or Chinese New Year.\n\nThese conditions show that economic factors, especially the weakening of real income and purchasing power, are the main determinants of the direction of people's mobility during the 2026 Eid homecoming - although the Minister of Transportation is optimistic that the realization of homecoming trips will be higher than predicted.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com,JAKARTA — Pengamat memandang tergerusnya pendapatan riil masyarakat menjadi faktor utama yang berpotensi menekan mobilitasmudik Lebaran2026. Alhasil, masyarakat lebih selektif merencanakan perjalanan ke kampung halaman tahun ini.\n\nKementerian Perhubungan (Kemenhub) sebelumnya memprediksi adanya penurunan jumlah masyarakat yang mudik atau melakukan mobilitas pada Lebaran tahun ini sebesar -1,7% terhadap survei 2025 dan -6,55% terhadap realisasi tahun lalu.\n\nKetua Institut Studi Transportasi sekaligus pengamat transportasi Ki Darmaningtyas sepakat dengan hasil survei dari Kemenhub. Menurutnya, penurunan memang terjadi akibat kondisi ekonomi riil yang masih lesu.\n\n“Kalau terjadi penurunan saya sepakat. Saya prediksikan menurun karena ekonomi memang lesu,” ujarnya kepadaBisnis,dikutip pada Rabu (18/2/2026).\n\nMenurutnya, salah satu kelompok yang terdampak adalah pada Aparatur Sipil Negara (ASN), yang menjadi kelompok penyumbang mobilitas mudik, akibat efisiensi maupun pembatasan perjalanan dinas.\n\n“ASN sekarang praktis hanya dari gaji dan tunjangan kinerja saja sehingga cenderung pas-pasan. Sebelumnya mereka memiliki pendapatan dari perjalanan dinas, dan itulah yang mereka tabung untuk mudik lebaran,” tambahnya.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nSelain ASN, pelaku usaha kecil seperti pengelola kantin sekolah juga disebut terdampak penurunan omzet akibat adanya program Makan Bergizi Gratis (MBG), sehingga ruang untuk menyisihkan tabungan mudik menjadi lebih terbatas.\n\nSenada, Direktur Eksekutif Center of Reform on Economics (Core) Indonesia Mohammad Faisal menilai terdapat sejumlah faktor yang menyebabkan adanya potensi penurunan jumlah pemudik, termasuk pendapatan yang turun.\n\nPelemahan tersebut tercermin dari data Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) November 2025, yang menunjukkan adanya penurunan upah riil buruh sebesar -0,06% dari periode Agustus 2025. Penurunan sebesar -5,29% juga terjadi pada Februari 2025 dibandingkan Agustus 2024.\n\n“Jadi terus melemah sebetulnya dari sisi pendapatan riil masyarakat dan saya rasa yang lebih banyak mengalami itu kalangan menengah ke bawah. Jadi ini yang menyebabkan juga saya pikir faktor penting kenapa ada potensi penurunan mobilitas orang pada lebaran 2026,” katanya.\n\nApalagi, lanjut Faisal, apabila sebagian perusahaan atau pemberi kerja yang menyicil ataupun tidak mampu memberikan THR sebesar yang diharapkan. Kondisi tersebut lantas berpengaruh terhadap rencana mudik.\n\nHal tersebut sejalan dengan daya beli masyarakat kalangan menengah ke bawah yang menurut Faisal belum terlalu kuat.\n\nMeskipun dari total permintaan dan total pengeluaran ada peningkatan dalam lima bulan terakhir menjelang Nataru diperkirakan akan berlangsung terus sampai dengan lebaran, tetapi indeks penjualan ritel masih terdorong oleh belanja dari kalangan menengah atas.\n\n“Sehingga sebagian mereka terpaksa memilih untuk lebih selektif lagi dalam berbelanja, termasuk untuk keperluan mudik. Untuk mudik itu bukan hanya ongkos transportasi saja yang dihitung,” lanjut Faisal.\n\nSelain itu, Faisal memandang masyarakat semakin selektif memilih waktu pulang kampung karena posisi lebaran atau liburan yang berdekatan dengan tahun baru maupun Imlek.\n\nKondisi tersebut menunjukkan bahwa faktor ekonomi, khususnya pelemahan pendapatan riil dan daya beli, menjadi penentu utama arah mobilitas masyarakat pada mudik Lebaran 2026—meski Menhub optimistis realisasi perjalanan pemudik akan lebih tinggi dari prediksi.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA -- The Central Statistics Agency (BPS) explained that the realization of Indonesia's economic growth in 2025 was 5.11%.\n\nDespite recorded growth, the distribution of community income is still quite unequal despite improvements compared to previous years.\n\nBPS as quoted on Wednesday (18/2/2026) noted that by September 2025, the top 20% of the population will have at least 44.80% of the total expenditure of the Indonesian population.\n\nIn terms of trend, this number is actually experiencing a decrease compared to September 2024 where the population of 20% and above was able to contribute 46.24% of the total population expenditure.\n\nMeanwhile, in contrast to the top 20% of the population, people in the middle 40% population category have experienced an increase in their role. This group was recorded as having a contribution of 35.92% of total expenditure. There is an increase in contribution compared to September 2024 which was only 35.35%.\n\nThis trend also occurs in the bottom 40% of the population. Their contribution increased from 18.41% in September 2024 to 19.28% in September 2025.\n\nAlso Read\n\nMeanwhile, Bank Indonesia (BI) reported that the average proportion of consumer income spent fell in January 2026, reaching its lowest point in the last 6 years.\n\nBased on data from the BI Consumer Survey January 2026, the average portion of people's income used for consumption fell to 72.3%. This figure has decreased compared to the previous month's position which was still recorded at 74.3%.\n\nIn fact, if we take historical data further back, the level of 72.3% is the lowest record since December 2020 or six years ago, when the consumption portion touched 69.0% due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThis decrease in the spending portion was followed by an increase in the allocation of income which was diverted to savings and paying loan installments.\n\nBI data shows that the proportion of income saved (savings) in January 2026 was at the level of 16.5%, an increase compared to the previous month which was 14.8%. This savings figure is also the highest since the beginning of 2023.\n\nApart from saving, people also appear to be more burdened by debt obligations. The ratio of loan installment payments to income was recorded to increase to 11.2% in January 2026, compared to 10.8% at the end of last year.\n\nIn terms of income demographics, the strongest action to hold money is carried out by the upper middle class.\n\nThe group with expenditures above IDR 5 million per month recorded the deepest decline in consumption share, namely only 70.1% of their total income.\n\nOn the other hand, the lower class who spend IDR 1-2 million per month still have to spend most of their income on living necessities, with the consumption ratio still high at 74.5%.\n\nAnomaly with Consumer Confidence This phenomenon created an anomaly at the beginning of 2026. This is because the latest Consumer Confidence Index (IKK) showed an increase of 3.5 points, from 123.5 in December 2024 to 127 in January 2026, the highest figure in the last year or since January 2025 (127.2).\n\nFor information, the survey conducted by BI shows consumer confidence in current economic conditions and their expectations for the future. IKK is an indicator that can be used to predict developments in household consumption and savings.\n\nIKK uses a reference year with a value of 100. This means that the consumer confidence index in January 2026 is in the optimistic zone or above the reference value.\n\n\"The Bank Indonesia Consumer Survey in January 2026 indicated that consumer confidence in economic conditions had increased compared to the previous month,\" said Executive Director of the BI Communications Department Ramdan Denny Prakoso in his statement, Monday (9/2/2026).\n\nBased on expenditure, the increase in IKK in January occurred in almost all groups, namely >5 million (from 128.3 to 134.3); IDR 3.1—4 million (from 118.3 to 120.7); Rp. 2.1—3 million (from 117.9 to 121.2); and IDR 1—2 million (from 113.7 to 118.8). Meanwhile, the Rp. 4.1-5 million expenditure group decreased from 129.2 to 124.2.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance (Kemenkeu) is preparing a strategy to accelerate the absorption of state spending to stimulate the circulation of money in society, after the allocation of public income for spending in early 2026 touched its lowest level in the last 6 years.\n\nDirector General of Economic and Fiscal Strategy at the Ministry of Finance, Febrio Nathan Kacaribu, stated that although data on the share of income for consumption has decreased, the Consumer Confidence Index (IKK) indicator has actually shown a consistent improving trend since September last year.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of holding back spending by households, Febrio emphasized that the government will take a more aggressive role through the State Revenue and Expenditure Budget (APBN) instrument.\n\n\"So we will continue to maintain public consumption and government spending will also be faster. So that money can circulate a lot in the economy,\" he said in Jakarta at the Supreme Court Building, Jakarta, Monday (9/2/2026).\n\nThe subordinate of the Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, admitted that he was optimistic that this strategy could maintain the momentum of economic growth that had already been formed. He highlighted the achievement of economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2025 which recorded a significant reversal to the level of 5.39%.\n\nThe government, he continued, has the ambition to maintain this positive trend in the first three months of this year. In fact, the Ministry of Finance is targeting higher economic growth in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\"So we hope that in Q1 [quarter I/2026] we will also maintain the momentum, so that we can maintain growth at around 5.5% and above,\" he said.\n\nFurthermore, Febrio believes that if the growth target above 5.5% is achieved through a combination of maintained household consumption and increased government spending, job creation will follow automatically.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA -- Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) memaparkan realisasi pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia pada tahun 2025 sebanyak 5,11%.\n\nMeski tercatat tumbuh, distribusi pendapatan masyarakat masih cukup timpang kendati ada perbaikan dibanding tahun-tahun sebelumnya.\n\nBPS sebagaimana dikutip Rabu (18/2/2026) mencatat sampai dengan September 2025, 20% penduduk teratas setidaknya memiliki 44,80% dari total pengeluaran penduduk Indonesia.\n\nSecara tren jumlah ini sebenarnya mengalami penyusutan dibanding September 2024 dimana penduduk 20% ke atas mampu berkontribusi sebesar 46,24% dari total pengeluaran penduduk.\n\nSementara itu, berbanding terbalik dengan 20% penduduk teratas, masyarakat yang masuk kategori penduduk 40% menengah mengalami peningkatan peranannya. Kelompok ini tercatat memiliki kontribusi sebesar 35,92% dari total pengeluaran. Ada kenaikan kontribusi dibandingkan September 2024 yang hanya 35,35%.\n\nTren tersebut juga terjadi di dalam kelompok penduduk 40% terbawah. Kontribusi mereka naik dari 18,41% pada September 2024 menjadi 19,28% pada September 2025.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nSementara itu, Bank Indonesia (BI) melaporkan rata-rata proporsi pendapatan konsumen yang dibelanjakan anjlok pada Januari 2026, menyentuh titik terendah dalam kurun waktu 6 tahun terakhir.\n\nBerdasarkan data Survei Konsumen BI Januari 2026, rata-rata porsi pendapatan masyarakat yang digunakan untuk konsumsi turun ke level 72,3%. Angka ini merosot dibandingkan posisi bulan sebelumnya yang masih mencatatkan angka 74,3%.\n\nBahkan, jika ditarik data historis lebih jauh ke belakang maka level 72,3% itu merupakan rekor terendah sejak Desember 2020 atau enam tahun lalu, yang mana porsi konsumsi sempat menyentuh 69,0% akibat hantaman pandemi Covid-19.\n\nPenurunan porsi belanja ini diikuti peningkatan alokasi pendapatan yang dialihkan untuk simpanan atau tabungan dan membayar cicilan pinjaman.\n\nData BI menunjukkan, proporsi pendapatan yang disimpan (tabungan) pada Januari 2026 ada di level 16,5%, naik dibandingkan bulan sebelumnya yang sebesar 14,8%. Angka tabungan ini juga merupakan yang tertinggi sejak awal 2023.\n\nSelain menabung, masyarakat juga tampak lebih terbebani oleh kewajiban utang. Rasio pembayaran cicilan pinjaman terhadap pendapatan tercatat naik menjadi 11,2% pada Januari 2026, dibandingkan 10,8% pada akhir tahun lalu.\n\nSecara demografi pendapatan, aksi tahan uang paling kencang dilakukan oleh kelompok masyarakat kelas menengah-atas.\n\nKelompok dengan pengeluaran di atas Rp5 juta per bulan mencatatkan penurunan porsi konsumsi paling dalam, yaitu hanya 70,1% dari total pendapatan mereka.\n\nSebaliknya, kelompok masyarakat bawah dengan pengeluaran Rp1-2 juta per bulan masih harus membelanjakan sebagian besar pendapatannya untuk kebutuhan hidup, dengan rasio konsumsi yang masih tinggi di level 74,5%.\n\nAnomali dengan Keyakinan KonsumenFenomena ini menciptakan sebuah anomali pada awal 2026. Pasalnya, Indeks Keyakinan Konsumen (IKK) terbaru menunjukkan kenaikan 3,5 poin, dari 123,5 pada Desember 2024 menjadi 127 pada Januari 2026, angka tertinggi dalam setahun terakhir atau sejak Januari 2025 (127,2).\n\nSebagai informasi, survei yang dilakukan oleh BI itu menunjukkan keyakinan konsumen terhadap kondisi ekonomi saat ini dan ekspektasi mereka terhadap masa depan. IKK merupakan indikator yang dapat digunakan untuk memprediksi perkembangan konsumsi dan tabungan rumah tangga.\n\nIKK menggunakan tahun acuan dengan nilai 100. Artinya indeks kepercayaan konsumen pada Januari 2026 berada di zona optimistis atau di atas nilai acuan.\n\n\"Survei Konsumen Bank Indonesia pada Januari 2026 mengindikasikan keyakinan konsumen terhadap kondisi ekonomi meningkat dibandingkan dengan bulan sebelumnya,\" kata Direktur Eksekutif Departemen Komunikasi BI Ramdan Denny Prakoso dalam keterangannya, Senin (9/2/2026).\n\nBerdasarkan pengeluaran, kenaikan IKK Januari terjadi di hampir semua kelompok yaitu >5 juta (dari 128,3 menjadi 134,3); Rp3,1—4 juta (dari 118,3 menjadi 120,7); Rp2,1—3 juta (dari 117,9 menjadi 121,2); dan Rp1—2 juta (dari 113,7 menjadi 118,8). Sementara kelompok pengeluaran Rp4,1—5 juta menurunkan dari 129,2 menjadi 124,2.\n\nKementerian Keuangan (Kemenkeu) menyiapkan strategi untuk mempercepat penyerapan belanja negara guna memacu perputaran uang di masyarakat, usai alokasi pendapatan masyarakat untuk belanja pada awal 2026 menyentuh level terendah dalam 6 tahun terakhir.\n\nDirektur Jenderal Strategi Ekonomi dan Fiskal Kemenkeu Febrio Nathan Kacaribu menyatakan, meskipun data porsi pendapatan untuk konsumsi menurun, indikator Indeks Keyakinan Konsumen (IKK) sebenarnya menunjukkan tren perbaikan yang konsisten sejak September tahun lalu.\n\nUntuk memitigasi risiko penahanan belanja oleh rumah tangga, Febrio menegaskan pemerintah akan mengambil peran lebih agresif melalui instrumen Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara (APBN).\n\n\"Jadi kita akan terus jaga konsumsi masyarakat dan juga belanja pemerintah juga kita pasti akan lebih cepat. Jadi supaya uang bisa berputar banyak di perekonomian,\" ujarnya di Jakarta di Gedung Mahkamah Agung, Jakarta, Senin (9/2/2026).\n\nAnak buah Menteri Keuangan Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa itu mengaku optimistis strategi ini dapat menjaga momentum pertumbuhan ekonomi yang sudah terbentuk. Dia menyoroti capaian pertumbuhan ekonomi pada kuartal IV/2025 yang mencatatkan pembalikan signifikan ke level 5,39%.\n\nPemerintah, lanjutnya, berambisi menjaga tren positif tersebut pada tiga bulan pertama tahun ini. Bahkan, Kemenkeu membidik pertumbuhan ekonomi kuartal I/2026 yang lebih tinggi.\n\n\"Jadi kita harapkan di Q1 [kuartal I/2026] ini juga momentumnya kita jaga, sehingga kita bisa jaga pertumbuhannya di sekitar 5,5% ke atas,\" ungkapnya.\n\nLebih lanjut, Febrio meyakini bahwa jika target pertumbuhan di atas 5,5% tersebut tercapai melalui kombinasi konsumsi rumah tangga yang dijaga dan belanja pemerintah yang digeber maka penciptaan lapangan kerja akan mengikuti secara otomatis.",

    "content": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — The Indonesian textile and textile products (TPT) industry has full hopes for the results of President Prabowo Subianto's meeting with United States President Donald Trump, namely a reciprocal tariff reduction.\n\nThe Association of Indonesian Fiber and Filament Yarn Producers (APSyFI) emphasized that although the United States market is strategic, the burden of tariffs makes it difficult for local products to compete with other countries that enjoy more competitive treatment.\n\nThe General Chair of APSyFI, Redma Gita Wirawasta, stated to Bisnis that reducing reciprocal tariffs was the only way for the Indonesian spinning industry to become competitive again in Uncle Sam's country.\n\n\"Of course we hope that the US will provide tariff relief so that our exports to the US can become competitive again, even though this is difficult without improvements on the industrial side,\" said Redma, Tuesday (17/2/2026).\n\nHowever, the realization of tariff reductions is not without challenges. The US asked Indonesia to increase cotton purchases from Uncle Sam's country as a condition for reducing tariffs from the previous 32% to 19%.\n\nThis request is a dilemma, because the utilization rate of the Indonesian spinning industry is currently still below 50%. This means that the ability to absorb additional cotton is very limited.\n\nAlso Read\n\nAPSyFI data notes that before the Covid-19 pandemic, Indonesia's total cotton imports reached around 600,000 tonnes per year, with half coming from the US.\n\nHowever, the import trend since 2022 has continued to decline, and in 2025 total imports will be recorded at only around 300,000 tonnes, with the portion from the US remaining at 70,000 tonnes. This decline reflects sluggish production activity in the spinning sector in recent years.\n\n\"So as long as the utilization of the spinning industry is below 50%, it is unlikely that our cotton imports from the US will increase,\" explained Redma.\n\nPressure on the industry does not only come from cotton, but also from the flood of imported products which are suspected of being sold through dumping practices, both in the form of cloth and yarn. This condition puts pressure on the domestic market and erodes demand for local products.\n\n\"It is impossible for spinning utilization to increase as long as dumped imported goods continue to flood the domestic market. Because the industry's main need is the market and fair competition,\" added Redma.\n\nThe national textile industry now depends on the government's ability in trade diplomacy. The success of the Prabowo–Trump meeting could potentially pave the way for lower tariffs and more competitive market access.\n\nAPSyFI hopes that diplomatic efforts will not only focus on reducing tariffs, but will also be accompanied by improvements within the country: adequate market protection, fair business competition, and support for increasing production capacity.\n\nHowever, as trade observers highlight, the industry's reliance on one market — the US — also makes the sector vulnerable. CSIS researcher, Yoshe Rizal Damuri, emphasized the importance of market diversification so that the industry does not stop when there are changes in tariff or regulatory policies in the US.\n\n“Our competitors are not necessarily cheaper, but they can benefit from preferential tariffs and clear trade rules,” Yoshe said.\n\nThe advantage of other countries, such as Vietnam, lies in market access through free trade agreements which provide more competitive tariffs, while Indonesia still faces high tariffs, so its competitiveness is relatively lagging behind.\n\nA similar phenomenon also occurs in the footwear industry. The United States is the main market with around 40% of total exports, and reciprocal tariff increases threaten the competitiveness of Indonesian products.\n\nHead of Aprisindo's Trade & International Negotiations Division, Devi Kusumaningtyas, said that the entry tariff for Indonesian footwear to the US was already very high, namely 7% -35%, and increased by 19% due to reciprocal tariffs.\n\n\"With these additional tariffs, total import duties could increase sharply and burden producers' cost structures,\" he said.\n\nThis shows that the tariff negotiations were successful not only important for textiles, but also for other manufacturing sectors that depend on the US market.\n\nBusiness people consider policy certainty to be the main factor in restoring investor confidence.\n\nDeputy General Chair of Apindo, Sanny Iskandar, emphasized the importance of active communication between the government and business actors. Dialogue forums, including direct meetings with the President, provide space for the business world to convey obstacles and offer solutions.\n\n\"We also convey the obstacles in the field but also provide solutions,\" said Sanny.",

    "content_original": "Bisnis.com, JAKARTA — Industri tekstil dan produk tekstil (TPT) Indonesia berharap penuh pada hasil pertemuan Presiden Prabowo Subianto dengan Presiden Amerika Serikat Donald Trump yakni penurunan tarif resiprokal.\n\nAsosiasi Produsen Serat dan Benang Filamen Indonesia (APSyFI) menegaskan bahwa meskipun pasar Amerika Serikat strategis, beban tarif membuat produk lokal sulit bersaing dengan negara lain yang menikmati perlakuan lebih kompetitif.\n\nKetua Umum APSyFI, Redma Gita Wirawasta, menyatakan kepada Bisnis bahwa penurunan tarif resiprokal merupakan satu-satunya jalan agar industri pemintalan Indonesia kembali kompetitif di Negeri Paman Sam.\n\n“Tentunya kami berharap AS akan memberikan keringanan tarif agar ekspor kita ke AS bisa kembali bersaing meskipun hal itu sulit tanpa ada perbaikan di sisi industrinya,” kata Redma, Selasa (17/2/2026).\n\nNamun, realisasi penurunan tarif bukan tanpa tantangan. AS meminta Indonesia meningkatkan pembelian kapas (cotton) dari Negeri Paman Sam sebagai syarat untuk menurunkan tarif dari sebelumnya 32% menjadi 19%.\n\nPermintaan ini menjadi dilema, karena tingkat utilisasi industri pemintalan Indonesia saat ini masih di bawah 50%. Artinya, kemampuan untuk menyerap kapas tambahan sangat terbatas.\n\nBaca Juga\n\nData APSyFI mencatat, sebelum pandemi Covid-19, total impor kapas Indonesia mencapai sekitar 600.000 ton per tahun, dengan setengahnya berasal dari AS.\n\nNamun, tren impor sejak 2022 terus menurun, dan pada 2025 total impor tercatat hanya sekitar 300.000 ton, dengan porsi dari AS tinggal 70.000 ton. Penurunan ini mencerminkan lesunya aktivitas produksi di sektor pemintalan dalam beberapa tahun terakhir.\n\n“Jadi selama utilisasi industri pemintalan berada di bawah 50%, kecil kemungkinan impor kapas kita dari AS bisa naik,” jelas Redma.\n\nTekanan terhadap industri tidak hanya datang dari kapas, tetapi juga dari membanjirnya produk impor yang diduga dijual dengan praktik dumping, baik dalam bentuk kain maupun benang. Kondisi ini menekan pasar domestik dan menggerus permintaan terhadap produk lokal.\n\n“Utilisasi pemintalan tidak mungkin bisa naik selama barang-barang impor dumping masih membanjiri pasar domestik. Karena kebutuhan utama industri hanyalah pasar dan persaingannya yang fair,” tambah Redma.\n\nIndustri tekstil nasional kini bergantung pada kemampuan pemerintah dalam diplomasi perdagangan. Keberhasilan pertemuan Prabowo–Trump berpotensi membuka jalan bagi tarif lebih rendah dan akses pasar yang lebih kompetitif.\n\nAPSyFI berharap upaya diplomasi tidak hanya fokus pada penurunan tarif, tetapi juga diiringi pembenahan di dalam negeri: perlindungan pasar yang memadai, persaingan usaha yang adil, dan dukungan terhadap peningkatan kapasitas produksi.\n\nNamun, seperti disoroti pengamat perdagangan, ketergantungan industri pada satu pasar — AS — juga membuat sektor ini rentan. Peneliti CSIS, Yoshe Rizal Damuri, menekankan pentingnya diversifikasi pasar agar industri tidak terhenti ketika terjadi perubahan kebijakan tarif atau regulasi di AS.\n\n“Pesaing kita tidak selalu lebih murah, tetapi mereka bisa diuntungkan oleh tarif preferensial dan aturan perdagangan yang jelas,” kata Yoshe.\n\nKeunggulan negara lain, seperti Vietnam, terletak pada akses pasar melalui perjanjian dagang bebas yang memberikan tarif lebih kompetitif, sementara Indonesia masih menghadapi tarif yang tinggi, sehingga daya saingnya relatif tertinggal.\n\nFenomena serupa juga terjadi pada industri alas kaki. Amerika Serikat menjadi pasar utama dengan porsi sekitar 40% dari total ekspor, dan kenaikan tarif resiprokal mengancam daya saing produk Indonesia.\n\nKetua Bidang Perdagangan & Perundingan Internasional Aprisindo, Devi Kusumaningtyas, menyebut tarif masuk untuk alas kaki Indonesia ke AS sudah sangat tinggi, yakni 7%-35%, dan bertambah 19% akibat tarif resiprokal.\n\n“Dengan tambahan tarif tersebut, total bea masuk bisa melonjak tajam dan membebani struktur biaya produsen,” ujarnya.\n\nHal ini menunjukkan bahwa keberhasilan negosiasi tarif tidak hanya penting bagi tekstil, tetapi juga bagi sektor manufaktur lain yang tergantung pada pasar AS.\n\nKalangan dunia usaha menilai kepastian kebijakan menjadi faktor utama untuk memulihkan kepercayaan investor.\n\nWakil Ketua Umum Apindo, Sanny Iskandar, menekankan pentingnya komunikasi aktif antara pemerintah dan pelaku usaha. Forum dialog, termasuk pertemuan langsung dengan Presiden, memberi ruang bagi dunia usaha untuk menyampaikan hambatan sekaligus menawarkan solusi.\n\n“Kita juga sampaikan hambatan di lapangan namun juga memberikan solusinya,” ujar Sanny.",
